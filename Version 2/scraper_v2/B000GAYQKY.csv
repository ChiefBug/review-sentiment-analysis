Reading the manuel is small and it'll be hard. I have 6 Casio watches, two of which are G-Shock. This is my favorite out of all of them. It seriously feels like I'm not even wearing it right now, wait am I?! Yes. Had to double check. Lol. Very comfortable watch and damn it looks good. One of the main reasons I bought this was not the price but because it's one of the very first G-Shock watches they made in Japan. And I was watching Speed movie and noticed this was the watch Keanu Reeves is wearing the entire movie. And this is the watch where they had a hockey player slap shock it and it didn't break. That's how it got popular and it still is. There's a reason for that, it lasts! Every Casio watch I own gets worn everyday as I switch them out depending on what I'm doing through the day. If I'm working on my truck, I'll wear the cheapest Casio watch so if it gets dirty, I don't really care but can still tell the time while I'm working on my truck or doing something. At work, I wear my Casio DW3502AE and that's one of my favorite watches to wear no matter what I'm wearing and got only $20 bucks, you'd think you paid more. I also have the Casio G shock DW9052 but it's pretty bulky and hard to read. I like the look but i hardly wear it. I love Casio and they make extremely reliable, slick and durable watches for anyone, casual, miliary and law enforcement. They're just indestructible and they have something for anyone."

Yeah, its the best! New to watches, but I thought I wouldn't like it as much as the smaller f91w. The increase premium feel makes me not want to wear the f91w! I thought it might feel/look too big. It's fine. Great simple look. Hourly chime is soft and not loud. I like that. I sync it up using time.gov every week and it keeps perfect time. Edit: I love this watch so much I decided to get the GW-5000u-1jf. I honestly just couldn't vibe with the color so I sent it back after a day. I preferred the look of this one. Plus this watch was basically in the movie Speed! After trying the Gw-5000u-1jf I like the softness of the band a lot. I wanted to put the same band on this watch but its around $48 and that's about how much I paid for the watch. So I settled on the Thailand band part number 10512401 for about $20 here on Amazon. It is a step up from the band that comes with this watch. It feels a bit better now... more soft. Not that it was bad before. The color looks like it actually blends better with the bezel now too. I hope they keep making this one. If they made a GW-5000U level watch with this color scheme id be all over it!"

I was on the fence with all the G-Shock square face variants. I chose the lowest cost, most basic model thinking I’d be unhappy with the screen contrast or build quality. Not at all! They’ve done a great job making this very nice watch for little money. I prefer not having the Bluetooth but the one thing I’d like is the rough solar. But not for the extra $100. Ended up liking the subtle color touches of the dw5600e face and I find the band comfortable. The whole watch is extremely light, making it easier to wear than my metal case watches. The case size is perfect too - not too big and not too small. Really happy with this watch and hope to have it for many years to come :)"

I've had four copies of this model in a row for 33 years since. I read that they are designed for 10 year life but I'm rough on them - I've used the case to hammer nails and crazy stuff like that. I have no need for any of the features or cost of the more expensive versions. I left the stopwatch running for a month once. I use the heck out of the light. Didn't seem to drain the battery much at all. I won't stop wearing them until I'm dead. They go surprisingly well with my business attire."

I personally can feel the weight of the electric currents from all the tech around us. This watch gives me a break from that electric current. Allowing me to relax in simplicity and enjoy life without the electric noise from my devices when I want to unplug. Also this watch is tough and I has no issues in the cold. Which my smart watch sometimes have when it’s gets to cold out. Well most electronics act up when it gets to cold out."

Plus, my wife thinks it looks very handsome on me. I just turned 30 today and I’m fairly fashion forward, especially considering my profession. I like to look nice and this watch is just slim enough for me to get away with wearing it with slacks and a tie, but also rugged enough to not break or scratch when I throw the earth at it.

Was hesitant to leave the Radio function but it has proved no problem. This has a built in calendar up to 2099 and keeps time beautifully so was easier to give up than thought. As for ruggedness and durability, this has handled 12 beach and pool days in a row, gym, biking (sweat) all with aplomb so far. It honestly fits any outfit with the black and brownish hue of screen and touches of white and blue. Size wise it wears absolutely perfectly for 6.75 in wrist - felt this immediately and didn’t have to “get used to it” I was initially considering the ~$100 one with multi-band 6 but didn’t feel price was worth it and glad I picked up this instead. One other note is that this has timer function down to seconds - which is NOT SUPPORTED in Multiband 6 variant - starts at minute. This is handy when doing 30-45second timed workouts."

Pushers are too hard to push!","There probably isn't much that I can add to what has already been said about this widely respected basic Casio G-Shock.  But I would mention a couple things that irritate me: 1.  The recessed 'pushers' (that control digital functions, on the outside corners of the watch) really are extremely difficult to 'push'.  A vocal minority of DW5600E owners will doubtlessly insist that the recessed pushers are just as they should be because this prevents them from being accidentally pushed.  Well, that is certainly not going to be a problem, I agree, but I think it should also be possible to push them intentionally, which for me at least requires taking off the watch and positioning a fingernail at just the right angle on a slippery, small metal surface and positioning another finger on the opposite side of the case to generate a sufficiently large amount of squeezing pressure to push the little circular pin-head like pushers far enough into the watch to engage.  With great effort I can sometimes push them with finger-tips, but my finger-tips become quite sore if I have to push them this way more than a couple times a day - it's ergonomic sadism!  I""m decking the watch 1/2 review star for the poor design of the pushers.  Yes, they shouldn't get pressed accidentally (at least not too easily), but they should be MUCH easier to push (and possible to push conveniently without taking off the watch). 2.  at least half the vertical space that is available for the LED is taken up by marketing blurbs that seem to be trying to get users to forget the word ""Indiglo"" and learn to call the glow in the dark feature ""ELECTRO LUMINESCENT BACKLIGHT""  and to recognize this item as an ILLUMINATOR model.  Personally I'd rather have an LED that's twice as tall so the digital numerals showing time/date and other information is easier to read.  I bought a digital Timex Expedition watch at the same time as this Casio, which has almost exactly the same amount of space for an LCD.  The Timex watch has it's own branding elements, (though not of the same crude tacky sort), but keeps them on tabs above and below the bezel, and also moves the pusher 'hints' (like stop/start) etc. off the LCD and onto the bezel.  The result is a digital readout that's about twice as large as this Casio's.  I guess it wouldn't be the DW-5600 classic anymore if Casio did something (sensible/useful) like that. If this were not otherwise such a nice watch, the inefficient use of available LCD space here would be penalized more than the 1/2 star I'm taking off. Otherwise, I think this is a very nice item.  The case is substantial, pleasantly weighty,  and it's construction is obviously very high quality.  The build quality elements surprised me & greatly exceeded my expectations.  These watches will definitely survive the coming Zombie Apocalypse.  I have no major complaint about the rubber strap, though it could be softer and more flexible.  You can't lay this watch flat (face-up) -- the band is curved and too stiff to flatten out.  Digital features are basic, but reasonably intuitive and work just fine.  The manual is pretty well written IMHO.  Packaging is cheap, but I really don't care or expect much for $40.00. I especially like the ""ELECTRO LUMINESCENT BACKLIGHT"" on this watch.  The dark jade/green color is really beautiful and makes the Cyan Indiglo back-lighting on the Timex I got seem cheap by comparison. I had a little trouble figuring out how to set the date at first, becoming confused by a field that seemed to increment from 00 to 100, till I read the manual and found this watch has a perpetual calendar feature, so the value there is to enter the year (from 2000-2100).  So that's quite nice actually. Also noteworthy - the watch I received is also very accurate.  It's been running at a rate that extrapolates to  +2.66 seconds per month,  roughly ~1/2 a min per year.  It's quartz movement has rated accuracy of +-15 secs/mo.  Most other Casio watches in the same or even somewhat higher price range(s) are rated either +-30 secs or +-20 secs.  It's easy to forget that keeping track of the time is, at least to a considerable extent, the purpose of a watch, and it would be difficult at this price to find one that does a better job."

I realized that I didn't have a digital in my collection, and it just so happened that I had also been looking for a beater watch, something to just wear around casually. I always knew the G-Shocks had a big following, so I decided to hop on the bandwagon and I settled on the DW-5600. I chose this watch because, to me, it looks the most ""classic"" of the G-Shock line. I didn't really care about Solar or Atomic capabilities, which also helped out on the price. On Amazon's end, they did an adequate job. The watch arrived when it was supposed to, but the box was a little beat-up when I got it. The packaging wasn't all that great, either, because inside the box only one single ""air-bag"" protected the item. I was a little disappointed in the packaging of the watch itself. It didn't come in one of those cool gray tins that you see online, or even one of the bigger square black and red G-Shock boxes. Instead, the watch was packaged in a small rectangular box containing a plastic stand with the watch on it and the module book folded in half and stuffed underneath. Not a big deal, but a little neater package would be nice. Now, onto the watch itself. When I opened the box, I was surprised at just how nice it looks. Really, the watch looks much better in person that it does in any of the photographs I've seen. Like I mentioned above, the watch has a very classic digital look, with a very simple, rugged, ""no-frills"" design. The band is resin, and at first glance doesn't really look that comfortable. However, once you put it on, it feels nice and smooth on your skin. The watch is also incredibly light (60g, according to Casio's website), so much so that I barely even notice it's there. The build quality feels very solid, and I have the feeling that the watch could withstand a pretty tough beating. The case has a Casio branded metal plate on the backside and a metal buckle on the band. The readout has a positive display and isn't clogged up with useless information, so it's very easy to read. You've got the day and date on top, and time on the bottom. The backlight is nice and bright, although I wish it would stay illuminated for longer than two seconds. The four buttons are located on each corner of the case and I had no problem pressing any of them except for the ""adjust"" button, which is recessed so you don't accidentally bump it and reset the watch. This is my biggest complaint about the watch, seeing how sometimes I have to take the watch off just press the adjust button. But, luckily you don't have to use it that often, so it's not a deal-breaker. As for the features of the watch, they're all pretty standard. There's no barometric pressure gauge, tide readouts, or moon-phase indicators, just the standard features. Pressing the lower left button lets you scroll through the watches four modes: Time, alarm, countdown, and stop-watch. These modes are self-explanatory, and the time is viewable in each mode. The watch gives a resounding ""beep"" when changing modes, and a slightly higher-pitched chirp when returning to time mode. The volume on the alarm is adequate. I consider myself to be a heavy sleeper, and the alarm woke me up just fine. Overall, the Casio G-Shock DW-5600E is a solid watch. It's classic design, sturdy construction, and refreshingly basic features make it a must-have digital in any collection, especially G-Shock enthusiasts. And, at just over $40, it's an incredible value. 4.5/5 stars"

I'm used to wearing the ones with the sensors, tough solar, and automatic time-keeping, and I didn't think I'd wear this one a lot.  But I actually wear it a lot!  This is the closest you'll get to the original 1983 DW 5000.  I can see why G-Shock fans love this watch. The light is pretty darn bright, and you also have a feature where you can make the watch light up whenever you have an alarm or the hourly time signal on.  Sure, it doesn't have auto-light, but hey, it's a classic G-Shock. It has the 3 basic functions: stopwatch with split time, a timer that runs 24 hours, and an alarm. Few things I need to mention for those considering getting this watch for the first time.  The stopwatch and timer both show the current time when you're in their modes.  This is one of the reasons I decided to get the DW 5600e.  I tried the GWM 5610 but I had to return it because both the stopwatch and timer would not display the current time. The timer: it runs 24 hours, and it displays the current time.  What's also cool about the timer is that you can also set seconds, and any amount of seconds is fine, whether you want 5 seconds or even just 2 seconds or so.  Very cool. As for the alarm, again, just one alarm.  An interesting thing about the alarm is that you can set an alarm for a certain month and day.  This would be cool if the watch had more than one alarm.  4 alarms would good for this kind of date feature.  I use a lot of alarms every day, so the month/day feature on the one single alarm is interesting. The beeps are pretty audible and it has that classic Casio sound.  However, keep in mind that the sound can't be muted.  Again, classic G-Shock. Unlike most modern squares, the adjust button is less visible on the side.  But it's not difficult to press.  In fact, all the buttons are easy to press. Also, whenever you play around with any of the modes of the watch, when you press the mode button, you automatically go back to the current time.  Since there's only 3 basic features and the buttons are easy to press, this isn't too big of a deal. Lastly, when setting current time, timer, and alarm, you only get one button to use after you press adjust, and it only goes forward.  I didn't like it at first, but when you hold the button down, the numbers more pretty fast.  I got used to it after a day or two. I've seen videos of people in Japan testing this particular watch, and man, it's a tough guy!  I've seen it been dropped from several stories high, crushed by machinery, sunk 200 M below the sea, and I've even seen it completely covered in mud.  It's almost as tough as a basic Mudmaster. The strap is extremely comfortable and the watch is so light you sometimes forget you're wearing it. The watch stays on beat almost all the time.  I never have to worry about adjusting the time once in a while or have it be off by a few seconds. Overall, this is an awesome watch and one that everyone, especially G-Shock fans, should have at some point in their lives.  There, I think I've covered everything I could."

For my little bit of money: the watch needs to stay on my wrist, keep time reasonably accurately, and possibly illuminate if I need to tell the time in the dark. Oh, and there needs to be some water resistance, since I don't take off the watch when I wash my hands, or take showers, or wash dishes, or do any of the other stuff that involves, well, water. Casio's G-Shock watches are, historically, amazing little gadgets that keep on keeping on even when you live everyday life while wearing them. However, as with so many other consumer brands, Casio's taken a giant step backward. For several months, the watch worked perfectly. Setting the time was a breeze, the illumination was nice and bright, and I did my daily things without worrying about killing the timepiece. When I say ""everyday things,"" I don't mean swimming or cliff diving or otherwise spending lots of time in wet environments. I don't swim well, and therefore don't enjoy it, and try not to spend more time in water than necessary as a result. After several months of mostly dry life, the display started acting wonky. If I tapped it, the time would reappear, for awhile at least. Because I didn't really feel like messing with a warranty return - and because i wasn't sure if the product were even still UNDER that warranty - I figured I'd open up the back and see what I could see. Was there a loose part? A strange battery issue? A stranger problem that none of you would believe even if I shot a video for you? Nope. It was the teeny tiny bit of rubber serving as ""moisture resistance"" inside the watch, behind the metal plate that you remove to access the battery. Even though I let the watch dry out for a few hours before closing it back up, the next shower I took made the problem come right back. Perhaps I shouldn't have opened up the watch myself - it's entirely possible that I didn't properly replace the tiny little strip of rubber - but, to be fair, the watch had taken in moisture BEFORE I busted out my tiny screwdrivers. What a piece of junk. I bought a comparable Timex from another retailer and have been happy since I took it out of its box. Maybe the higher-end G-Shocks are still good, but I'm not spending money to find out."

This band is more flexible, and the watch isn't as large as most of the other G-Shocks. Casio does make the Baby G-Shock line that is smaller (but sometimes has less water resistance). I didn't want ""Baby"" on my wrist, so this G-Shock fits my needs perfectly."

For a G-shock, the watch wears smaller on wrist than I expected (very comfortable, really) and would remain on my wrist at all times (sleep, showers, etc.) but not for an automatic that needs worn to remain ticking. The functions are fairly intuitive and there is no mistaking the Casio alarm sound. I have no fear of water damage (but haven't dived with it or tested that past splashes during daily activities). The illumination works well and the display is easy to read, even under full sun. I do think mine might be a bit defective bc the display actually shows more contrast at a slight angle (weird) but whatever, I'll get another for the sake of comparison. I sort of wish i'd have gotten the atomic clock-set + solar powered model, but for half the cost this one is great. I've heard the battery will prbly last about 5 yrs, the resin band may last 2x that long with daily wear; realistically, this could be the only watch i need for the next third of my life. And it looks awesome, a tidy little square with neat lines of text framing the functions. I like the nostalgic vibes (dads wore square Casios from Walmart - not G-shocks - when I was a kid in the 80s). I cannot recommend this or any G-shock highly enough. If ya know, ya know."

Those of you who wish you were tall, stop it. Tall people can't find clothes, eyewear, shoes, hats, or jewelry to name a few. They can barely fit in some cars. On to the watch review. The wristband is too small for someone who has an 8.5-inch wrist. I wear it on the first notch when my wrist is swollen and on the 2nd notch when it isn't. I do like the watch itself. My favorite part is the readout display. It shows the day of the week, month, day of the month, and the time all on one easy-to-read face. One look and I have all of the date information I need when filling out paperwork. I say that because not all watches have as much information on one display. At first, I didn't think I would like the Adjust button because it is recessed and stiff. However, I found that the more I use it the easier it gets. I don't know if the button needs to be used to loosen up or if I have trained my muscle memory to press it just right. Whatever the case, the adjustment button isn't as bad as I thought it would be. I would have liked a wriststrap to accommodate above-average people. Other than that, this watch is worth the price for sure."

Glickman","17 May 2021","5.0","Great Watch (and a comparison to the Casio W800H)","I collect watches and never thought I’d want a G Shock as all the G Shocks I’ve seen on my friends wrists did not appeal to me.  But I absolutely love this one and am convinced it is the best value of the entire G Shock  line.  I have been wearing a Casio W800H and I’m going to compare the two.  They are close in size (G Shock is bigger).  The G Shock is more comfortable to wear due to its pre-curved and higher quality strap.  The G Shock is also more attractive on the wrist due to a much better looking case and strap and a matte black finish.  G Shocks have a certain “street cred” that the cheaper Casio digital watches just don’t have.  It is also far tougher than the cheaper Casio, very well made and incredibly durable, probably indestructible, and the recessed mineral glass screen is far more protected than the acrylic screen on the W800H, which is quite vulnerable to scratches.  A very impressive 200 m water resistance (compared to 100 m on the W800), a superb back light (far better than the W800H) and if I ever get a chance to go to space, it is also NASA approved.  Bottom line: this G Shock is better looking, more durable, more comfortable and has more presence on a man’s wrist than the W800H.  It also wears nice and light for a watch its size, which is a big plus for me. The downsides compared to the W800H: is three times the price I paid for the W800H (but all these watches are extremely affordable), the digital numbers that tell the time in the display are smaller than the numbers in the display of the W800H (but still readable), battery life is lower, and the four buttons on the G Shock are very stiff and much more difficult to use than the buttons on the W800H (probably necessary to achieve the very impressive 200 m water resistance). I am choosing this G Shock as my daily watch this summer.  I am really happy with it."

I wore a DW6600 for years and years until it finally got stolen a few months ago. I figured I'd just do what I did last time I lost my original 6600 over 10 years ago - go buy a New Old Stock one on eBay or Amazon. Well lo and behold, it turn out that Bradley friggin Cooper ruined that for me by prominently wearing one in ""American Sniper""... Now all of a sudden a NOS 6600 was selling for over $200. Well screw that. I loved the 6600 but truthfully I often felt it was too big and it hurt my hand when I bent my wrist back. So I decided to see what else there was - and was delighted to find that Casio had re-released the original 5600. In the course of my browsing I also saw the 5610 and was interested to see how the two might compare. So I purchased both - and of the two and I ended up keeping the 5610. Here, briefly is why... This one has simplicity on its side - there are only the 4 traditional modes: Time, Alarm, Stopwatch, and Timer. The 5610 by contrast has another mode - a 2nd time mode that appears on the first click through the modes. This mode tells you the time in one of any of the other time zones in the world, and as far as I'm concerned this is a completely useless feature... I suppose if you are one of those people that always needs to know what time it is in Hong Kong and can't seem to remember how to add or subtract then this is great. Otherwise it's just a useless extra step I have to go through to get to the other modes. It's a small thing but it annoys me and so I consider this another mark in the 5600's favor. Another thing that stands out on the 5600 vs the 5610 is the length of time the EL stays lit. The 5600 stays illuminated for just over 2 seconds, the 5610 for maybe just 1.5 seconds - it maybe seem like a tiny difference but it is noticeable, noticeable enough that when I first got my 5610 I was annoyed by it. And lastly - the 5610 flashes it's EL when an alarm goes off. This is actually a pretty useful feature for me since I often work in noisy and dark circumstances. So why then did I decide on the 5610? Well - the 5610 has 4 alarms, which comes in handy for me. The build quality just feels way better to me. The numerals are larger. The screen is brighter - I mean even without the EL. It never has to have the time set - Atomic clock sync takes care of that. It is solar powered so will never need a battery replacement. It looks nicer (to me) with the red accents around the face. It's more flexible setting alarms and timers since you can go both up and down if you accidentally go past your alarm time (the 5610 only goes up). But the BIGGEST hit against the 5600 is this: the damn ADJUST button is SO recessed into the case that I can't even activate it with my fingers. Now granted I have big fingers and no nails, but that is probably true for a lot of guys who might buy this watch. And the fact that I need a friggin' toothpick or paperclip or a pen to press and hold it down is really a total deal killer. Both my old 6600 and the 5610 have a recessed button that can't be activated accidentally, but both can be easily activated by me despite my big fat fingers. So in the end I decided to spend the extra $40 and keep the 5610 and I'm pretty happy so far... *Note that the price difference seems to have gotten bigger since just a few weeks ago and now the 5610 is about $60 more."

Anderson","16 Jul 2019","5.0","A G-Shock for people who hate giant watches","I originally bought this watch as a ""beater"" watch so that I wouldn't have to worry about destroying the Pro Trek my wife got me for my birthday (not likely but just in case) or my Bulova automatics while at work. I managed to pick up a ""Casio Royale"" on clearance locally for less than $5 that I was going to use as a beater instead, but I like it well enough that I didn't want to ruin that watch (or the other small cheap Casios I have) on the daily either. I've never been a fan of G-Shocks primarily due to only having really seen their giant 50+mm hypertacticool ones I see lots of military guys wearing, which put me off the brand / series for a very long time. Given the price, and having seen that this model in particular is one of the very few watches officially certified for the space program I figured I'd make the jump. Pros: - It's very lightweight, so much so that it's easy to forget you're wearing it. - The backlight works extremely well. - Having a countdown timer as well as an alarm and stopwatch are great. - It's certified for space travel! - It was less than $45 - Water resistance is phenomenal. - ""Positive"" display - I absolutely adore the look of the negative display, but for actually using as a tool watch and not a fashion accessory the positive display is much, much easier to read at a glance than the negative display models. Cons: - No motion activated backlight. I got spoiled with my Pro Trek and miss being able to check the time in the dark without having to press the button. - No frills. The more expensive versions of this watch with moon phase / tide data are really appealing, but as a sub-$45 beginning step into the foray of non-gaudy G-Shocks I can live with it. - No solar / atomic timekeeping. Again it's less than $45 and realistically battery changes aren't that frequent or difficult, but the peace of mind with solar is nice to have. - The adjust button (top left) is intentionally recessed to prevent accidental presses, but realistically for me at least it also appears to do an excellent job of preventing most intentional presses too. I'd imagine this will get easier as I use it but for now I prefer the Pro Trek's non-recessed and easy to press buttons. All in all I would purchase this watch again without hesitation. It is great value for money if you need a basic timepiece that is nearly impossible to destroy."

For all the wristwatches I have gone through, I never considered a g-shock for inexplicable reasons but after my Luminox watch began displaying the symptoms of a dying battery (amid other problems) I figured it was time to move on. Now like so many other reviewers, I can corroborate all but the most sycophantic evaluations of the classic Casio G-shock. The Classic G-Shock DW5600E-1V is perhaps the most inexpensive digital watch entry of Casio’s most durable watch series. Designed in the early ‘80s as a watch that could survive a fall from 10 feet and be submersible up to 10 meters (a little less than 33 feet) of water, the result was a line of both analog, digital, and hybrid wristwatches.  Even in this most basic configuration, the watch is made of a tough plastic yet premium feel and weight that radiates toughness.  The watch is simple to use with only four features – clock, stopwatch, alarm, and timer – it is truly a no-nonsense watch for the person who only needs the basics. For no and low-light users, the entire display lights up in a bright light green. It is a great watch for the likes of myself who only needs to know the date and time.  First off, I think it’s important it has a water-resistance to 20 Bars and oddly for all its claims, I do not think it has any IPX rating – not that I have any doubts to its specifications.  In another of its undocumented features, multiple reviews (and I think Casio themselves) have pointed out that the recessed button design was intentional [to prevent accidental mode changes] and can be a problem for people who have large fingers or wearing gloves. The time setting button on the upper left is the most recessed of them all and will require someone with at least a modest fingernail or key tip to confidently press it – making matters worse that this button used to reset stopwatch and timer.  Somewhat surprisingly, Casio’s continued to integrate a proprietary fixed-curved watchband that prevents it from lying on a flat surface so don’t be too quick to throw away the stand it comes with. Nevertheless, I still think is a great watch.  Coupled with my purchase of a screen protector, I am looking forward to +15 years of punctuality (comparable to the Luminox watch it is set to replace). Between my work that discourages personal calls and my indifference to my smartphone, I can go days without my phone but not without knowing the time - with the simplest G-shock, knowing that is as simple as a flick of my wrist."

Stafford","18 Sep 2020","5.0","A Tough  and Simple Classic","I am very glad I didn’t buy this watch first when I started my Casio collection, because it would have been my one and only, and that is saying something since I’m such a watch nerd. It’s as close as you can get to the original G-Shock from 1983. Call it a spiritual successor. It’s rough and tough: mine came in a box that looked as if it had been ambushed by a Nile crocodile and it worked splendidly. But don’t take my word for it: this model is rated to be worn in outer space by NASA and it holds the Guinness World Record for most pressure applied to a digital watch.  Check out the YouTube video of this tough mommy fudger getting ran over by a 25 ton truck! I knew all about the toughness of the G-Shock brand, but I think what surprised me the most about this watch was just how damn good it looks on my wrist. It’s retro but still aesthetically valid. That’s a great description and it would probably sell a lot of watches, but it’s also the best way I can express my truth for this one. Take a look at the picture I’ve attached to this review. I have a half dozen Casio watches now, most of them G-Shocks. This is by far my favorite looking watch. Looks and legendary reliability aside, this watch has all the standard features you’ve come to know and to love from Casio. It’s got precisely what you need and not a gram more: a backlight that actually illuminates the whole screen, a stopwatch, an hourly chime, and just a single alarm, but you can get quite in-depth with it thanks to its many functions. You can set it to go off at any time of day, every day, every Monday, on the 17th of every month or on April 5th, 2063. For you sharp eyed fellow Star Trek lovers out there, yes, that is First Contact Day, when the Vulcans arrive on planet Earth. They probably find wristwatches illogical but if they were going to wear one it’d surely be this Casio G-Shock."

I remembered I once had a G-Shock I took to Brazil and thrashed it for a couple of years and even slept/ bathed in it and it was going strong till the day I gave it to my brother in law (who lost it)! It was a different model than the 5600e but lived up to the G-Shock name, which is why I bought this one. I wanted a watch that I could wear all the time and not worry about, unlike my more expensive watches that I have ended up selling because I was always afraid of breaking them. The added 1983 retro style it has is just an added bonus! This watch is much larger in size than the f91w and does not rattle. The green backlight is nice and this watch does everything a watch should. So accurate time keeping you could ""set your watch to it."" The best part of this watch is that buttons do mot get pushed accidentally. If you have anything of a stub of a fingernail you should be able to push these buttons just fine. I bought it from Amazon, and the ones they sell are authentic, but made in China. I guess they no longer produce these in Taiwan, and it seems almost everything these days is now made in China. I like to modify things so I have already converted mine to a reverse display (white numbers on black background- there are tutorials online how to do this) and when I had the case open it said ""Casio China no jewels"" so the movement is also made in China. It still seems built well, other than the top left adjust button is recessed a little more than the others (it was purposely designed this way) and the white ""G Shock"" and ""protection"" writing is actually more of a greyish hue compared to previous models; which doesn't matter to me because I also blacked it out to copy the much more expensive military version of the 5600e. Also, while I had the case open there is a small spring that if you pull it out the watch no longer beeps. For me this is a plus: I don't like my watches to beep since I prefer to wake up to my cell phone. But beware when changing batteries not to lose this spring if you value the beep. There are many tutorials online if you decide to change the battery yourself. The owners manual states the battery supplied will last about 2 years depending on backlight usage. If you never use the backlight, it could last up to 10 years on the same battery, but either way you can find replacement batteries very cheap on ebay. All in all this watch is the perfect size and weight, feels great, and so far has taken quite a beating over the 2+ years I have used it and is living up to the G-Shock name."

However, one of the image on Amazon.com (US) for this watch show the Foxfire version, sadly the version of the watch when it arrived was the Illuminator version. This is not the Japanese version, Amazon should update the website photo AND  the watch arrived in a paper box and plastic display NOT metal tin. Need to update your photos guys. Overall, great watch, the timer can be set to repeat, great for a reminder to take your medication or when you need to be reminded and keep a busy schedule (new parents). Great for 'desk divers' where you need a more then durable and water resistant to 200 meters watch. This DW5600 will more than survive home life! Just rinse off the watch if it gets dirty, if your worried about scratching the mineral crystal, get a screen protector. There are videos to show you how to mod (modify) this watch (strap extension, so you can use nato straps, change out the bezel/case and to clean the watch module)? This is the second thinnest G-Shock next to GA2100 (Casi-oak) I'm wearing my DW5600 with my Casio Duro  MDV106 both on a nato strap and a strap extension with the 5600. This setup allows me to have alarm, chimes, analogue watch and track two time zones, I like my Duro! Hey you do you. Both are durable and have 200 meters of water resistance."

If I happen to fall in the lake while kayaking, or smother it in snow, or land wrist first on a rock it will be fine. I love the 80s style of a lot of Casio digitals and this one fits right in. It fits my small wrist. It's definitely bigger and heavier than my favorite, the W-93H, but not by too much, and it has all the same features, including a timer that auto repeats, which I always appreciate. The manual doesn't mention it but if you use the bottom right button while setting the timer, you can toggle the auto repeat, so that it will immediately start counting down again while the alarm goes off. It helps me know when I'm half way through a workout of a set duration. Display could stand to be sharper and clearer like the F105 but it's not a deal breaker. This is definitely the most durable wristwatch you're going to get for $40 and it has the added perk of looking like it teleported in from 1987. I'll probably stick to the W-93H most of the time just because it disappears onto my wrist better, but this will certainly be my hiking and kayaking watch."

I became interested with the Invicta submariner homage, then moved my way over to Orient Mako, then to Seiko SKX173, and finally I was going to be happy with a Seiko Monster. However, by chance I saw a digital watch in one of the recommended listings on Amazon. I started thinking about the purpose of owning a watch and my conclusion was simple - to tell time...accurately. Automatic watches are great for people who appreciate the engineering involved in creating such timepieces. The only qualm I have with these watches is they are not precise...and they are delicate...and they need maintenance. Thus my search for the ultimate watch began. This week long journey ultimately brought me back to the first watch manufacturer I've ever owned - Casio. Growing up, my Casio would be on my wrist through many adventures, be it climbing a tree...then falling down shortly after, or swimming in the Pacific Ocean, or in a math test in class...I got an A by the way =) I started looking for a simple yet rugged Casio...and guess what? I finally found it~! The Casio DW5600E-1V is an amazing watch. When I got this bad boy out of the box, I was amazed by how much better it looks in person vs pictures online. Trust me everyone, the pictures simply don't do justice. I began setting the time and noticed the adjust button was recessed. This worried me because I thought I got a defective watch. But alas, after some research I found out this was the design Casio had intended. I strapped this new watch on and was blown away...again~! I love the fact that it's not overly bulky and does not dig into my wrist. The digits are big enough so that one can tell time in a glance. A plus about this particular model is that the day, date, and time are displayed on the same screen. The illumination is perfect. It was bright enough that I used it as my light source earlier this evening to help my wife differentiate the right key to open the door. I appreciate the fact that the countdown timer in this model allows one to adjust the second, minute, and hour. The other models...for some strange reason only has a 60 minute CTD...yet they have a stopwatch that can count till all the digits become 9. What gives? I do not plan on using the alarm on this watch very often, but in the moments that I do, I like how it's not overly complicated i.e. 5 different alarms. This watch is durable yet light and has a big screen to tell time yet does not dominate my 6.75 inch wrist. I've only had my DW5600 for two days but I know it will serve as my accurate and durable timepiece for many new adventures to come."

Every. Day. All. Day.  Never take it off unless its covered in mud, muck, or blood. Yes, sometimes its mine too.  Daily workouts, dirt bike, canoes,  fishing boats, jeeping...tons of hard knocks.  Same watch, same battery.  Since basic training in 1985 I have basically worn the same kind of watch... I got my kids wearing these now too.  Best watch ever made to me) (updated 8/2013)  AMAZING WATCH!  I was thinking about how tough, light, and perfect this watch was the other day after I was finished with an appointment in my dress clothes...and thinking back to the weekend when I abused this watch repeatedly with action sports, bug sprays, paint thinner (after getting some overspray paint on it, had to clean it up) and just all manner of dust, mud, swimming, etc....just a 'normal weekend' for me...and this great watch. It still looks brand new.  It's classy and refined in a boardroom and tough as nails in the outdoors, I just love it.  I will probably buy myself a backup...but it hasn't come off my wrist in 8 months...and i doubt it will in 8 years!  I just LOVE the fact that everying I need is on ONE screen and a simple light for the dark.  I don't use anyting but the main screen I've found out...but the time, date, and day is essential to me filling out various financial forms...and this unit has it all - right there one the main screen.  I'm VERY happy with this watch. I can't say enough good things about the watch and the great reviews here on Amazon about it.  It's all I need and nothing I don't. I came off slightly over 5 years of constantly wearing an ""outdoor computer"" watch on my wrist...really big - had alti, compass, baro, temp, gobs of alarms, timers, and settings....I barely used any of them...and now with iphones, I can easily get most of those features as apps.... if I ever really needed them. What this watch is...is a nice change I didn't know I really needed.  I like that it fits under my shirt sleeve and suit jacket sleeve better.  It's as tough as they come, and I've been able to use it shooting all day, banging around woods and campsites, using the chainsaw and maul for firewood...you name it...it's been perfect.  I like the night-light feature, mine is a green shade, very easy to see...and I LOVE that the day, date, and time are what is displayed on the home screen (all I've ever used - all I need.) This watch is perfect from the backyard swimming pool to a boardroom presentation.  Which is perfect since I never, ever take off my watch anyway."

So to that, I'll give my own viewpoint(s). 1)  Like many, I wore basic cheaper Casio watches growing up as a kid, in fact I think I had one on my wrist 95% of the time from the time I was 8 or so up into high school.  They were durable, functional, efficient, and basically maitenance free. I even remember trying a few Timex watches back then and not liking them for several reasons, always going back to Casio. Fast forward 20 years and I now have tastes for Tags, Hamiltons, Omegas, etc...watches that cost 20x or more what a Casio costs and which I can wear to casual, work, and dress environments.  However I found the need to still have a beater watch with some functional capabilities that I could use in certain situations when working around the house or just getting dirty.  I immediately went looking for a Casio, quickly found my way to this basic G-Shock, and less than a week after it came in the mail and I wore it a few times, I almost didn't want to put any of my other ""luxury"" watches back on because the Casio had quickly become one of my top favorites.  I now remember why I always loved these as a kid and this particular G-Shock is just perfect in so many ways.  I'm not a huge fan of some of the larger more gaudy G-Shocks, but then again I'm not reveiwing those...I'm reviewing the DW5600E-1V...and if I could give it 6 Stars I would.  I won't get into the specifics of why I like it, you can read any of the other nearly 300 positive reviews for it, but for all the basic reasons it is near perfect. 2)  My other thought on this review was what could people knock this watch for?  So basically that small group of people that gave it 1 or 2 stars, what was their story?  I wanted to see it from their perspective.  What I found out is that most of them didn't like this watch for things that any informed consumer would've known prior to buying.  Their complaints were somewhat subjective (too small display;  too large on wrist;  buttons too hard to push;  functions not exactly to their liking; etc...).  A few were viable though, in that there wasn't the ability to have the background illumination on when setting alarms, or a few who noted the band had broken under common wear.  All in all I guess its impossible to please 100% of the people, but like I said earlier, with over 315 reviews and more than 290 of them positive...you know what you're getting."

When I opened the package, the watch box lid was open and the bottom of the box was torn. Inside, the watch was sort of haphazardly covered with a loose plastic bag. The time on the watch was an hour off, but the minutes were correct. This all gave me the impression this watch may have been previously owned and returned. Closer inspection of the box doesn't show any broken seals, tapes, or stickers and the watch itself doesn't have any blemishes. It seems odd that there isn't a ""factory seal"" on the box. Perhaps a brand new box is completely wrapped in plastic. Not sure. Hopefully, this watch doesn't have issues. I selected this watch because, for decades, this model and the G-SHOCK line have had a reputation for durability. I can wear a nice watch for those occassions that warrant one, but I need a beater watch that can keep up with my everyday lifestyle. After going through a few $10 bangers and a Timex Ironman, I decided to spend a bit more on a more durable product. Despite being relatively inexpensive and primarily selected for functionality, this watch makes a little bit of a stylish statement, too. I like the looks even better than I expected. Time will tell on the durability."

It's light, comfortable, keeps decently accurate time (about +5 sec/month, so far), has all the basic features one would need (alarm, stopwatch, countdown timer, perpetual calendar until 2039, etc.) and is built for survival.  This is a no frills, no nonsense, dependable, functional watch.  It also features the classic square Casio design, which is timeless, in my opinion.  I love the DW-5600E so much that I also picked up a DW-5025B on eBay.  There's not much more to say in the way of praise - the G-Shock series is well-established and respected. On to some other things of interest: The 5600E has a plastic case underneath the resin bezel, with only a metal plate screwed on to the back.  It's no secret that Casio stopped producing fully stainless steel watch cases for their G-Shocks years ago.  Now, only limited edition, anniversary edition, and other special releases include one.  Some have argued that the plastic case is more shock resistant in comparison to rigid metal.  I am a bit neurotic, though, so it only took me a week or two before I went crazy about this plastic case business - I buy watches to last a lifetime.  That may sound silly considering it's a $40 Casio, but it's not silly to me.  If this is a disposable purchase for you, forget about the case and enjoy the watch. Another note about the pitfalls of a plastic case: bezel and battery swaps pose an issue, because the tiny screws are seated in plastic threads.  It's entirely possible to strip the threads if you're not careful (and plenty of people have done it).  Of course, there are also stories about people getting screws stuck in the metal cases, as well.  Either way, just be careful and pick up a JIS screwdriver, because those screws are not Philips.  People seem to like Hozan or Wiha tool brands. You can attach strap adapters to the 5600E in order to use Zulu/Nato straps.  This is a good option because nylon straps will last much longer than the OEM resin strap, are much stronger, and, to most, are more comfortable, too.  Installing the adapters yourself can be a major PITA (I'm speaking from experience) - read around watch forums for accounts of this.  You could even end up breaking something if you're not skilled, so it may be worth taking your watch to a professional.  The adapters are available from Casio Parts Department directly - call 1-800-223-2001 and order part #74243710 (you'll need to order two because they don't come in a pair).  I spent less than $7 for parts and shipping, as opposed to some other sources online which charge over double that.  Maratac and Timepiecerepublic on eBay offer the best Zulu/Nato straps. Hope this helps.  Join the 5600 club and be part of a legend!"

The Atomic Time in the higher model is over hyped as well, this is the watch that can do just what the DW-5600 can do with a cleaner look. Note. The Fox Fire on the face of the watch is replaced with ""illuminator"" I think Fox Fire was the old Model with different light system. I took a star off for mine because it did not have the screen protector and I think it could have been a return, not a big deal. The Watch itself is a 5 star watch.

The digital display is easy to read -- and quick to reference for someone always on the go. Runs maybe 4-5 seconds fast per month, but that's fine by me, I'd rather have it run slightly fast than slow. Overall, zero complaints! Just be aware that the face reads, ""Illuminator"" instead of ""Fox Fire"" as shown in the product images. This instantly become my daily driver :)"

It isn't fancy but it does what it's supposed to, which is tell time. I work on the roads and I'm outside in all kinds of weather. One day I may be clearing trees after a storm and the next I may be paving. I wanted a watch that was easy to read, comfortable to wear and durable to handle the weather of the PNW as well as my work. It is very comfortable to wear, probably one of the most comfortable watches I've ever had. I can read it in direct sunlight without any issue. Rain and mud don't bother it. This is my first G-shock watch and I'm very happy with it. If you need a tough watch that will hold up and is comfortable, this is your watch. No watch is perfect though and this wouldn't be a fair review if I didn't discuss the cons of it. The only con I have discovered this far, is the buttons. Particularly the button that is for adjusting the time. It is pretty difficult to press, I actually have to use my finger nail to activate it. Is it a big deal, no. But it is something people should be aware of. Setting of time is very easy and straight forward though. Another minor issue which might be of concern to some is the alarms. This watch only has one. To me that is fine, because I don't use watch alarms. But some people like them. So if you're someone that is a frequent user of watch alarms, this watch only has one alarm. Overall this is a great watch,  and is an excellent entry into the G-shock line."

The DW-5600E-1V is the latest iteration in the traditional 'square' format (it's actually rectangular) of the family. With a water resistance rating of 200m and the ability to withstand a fall from 10m this watch is more than able to take a beating, especially if you keep it on your wrist!  While it lacks many of the bells and whistles of the modern G-Shocks like atomic signal reception and numerous sensors the 5600 makes up for it in pure simplicity with a easy to use interface and quick operation. Each mode is accessed, like its brethren, by pushing the mode button in the lower left. The modes on this model include (in addition to timekeeping) an alarm, a stopwatch, and a countdown timer. The alarm can be set to a specific day or during a specific month (or specific day of the month).  The stopwatch will run to 23:59'59 (that's 1 second shy of 24 hours) with accuracy to the 1/100th of a second for the first hour. The countdown timer can be set from 1 second to 24 hours with an optional auto-repeat function. Current time is shown in both countdown and stopwatch mode, a feature sadly lacking in many of the newer models. There is, of course, a wonderful backlight function that lights up the entire screen making it easy to read even in the darkest of situations. It can also be set to light up when an hourly signal or alarm goes off (this is that symbol above the seconds display). The light is actuated by pressing the lower right button. This positioning is different from the older models but I personally find it more useful as operating the stopwatch and countdown timer is done through the upper right button, a much more natural feeling for those of us who are perhaps used to traditional chronographs. This is also how the watch is adjusted to display in 12h/24h modes (when setting the time). Speaking of adjustment, adjusting modes only takes a single press of the adjust button, much quicker than the newer models! Oh yeah, it also serves as a great watch too; mine runs within 1-2 seconds a month of UTC, pretty impressive for a watch that costs less than $50. Battery life is rated at 2 years but unless you're constantly using the backlight you should be able to pull at least another year or two out of the watch before replacement. The 5600 definitely has that 80s vibe going on so it may not be your desired fashion statement, but if you're looking for a tough, reliable watch you can't go wrong with this classic G-Shock."

The resin case denotes the exact same rubbery, soft texture on the other g shocks I own at a fraction of the cost at 38 dollars. The only 2 gripes I have is that the LCD screen looks a lot more cloudy and faded on mine than most of my other digital watches and so it is admittedly a bit harder to see at first glance. Secondly, the adjustment button is recessed into the case much further than the other buttons and due to the curvature of the actual resin case it is very hard to get the button to activate without the use of a pen or another slim tool"

I am not comfortable wearing a watch that I may loose due to a faulty bracelet clasp. The crystal is also scratched pretty bad and the numbers on the bezel have all but worn off. I know I could get a replacement bracelet for the Luminox and possibly a new bezel, but I want a no BS watch. My Luminox will be retired as my EDC watch. My search is over! The DW5600E-1V arrived March 8th and I have worn it non stop (except showering, I just don't like to wear watches in the shower, even though the watch can handle it). Coming from a steel bracelet I was somewhat worried that the rubber strap on the DW5600 would irritate my skin and cause it to sweat. No problem in that department. The watch is very comfortable to wear and much lighter than the Luminox, which I used to remove before bed. In my opinion the watch is the perfect size. Not to big, but not too small. Just right and doesn't infer with clothing and hanging up on things. The functions of this watch are PERFECT and they have been getting a good test. I like that the menu structure is simple and to the point...no BS. The alarm could be louder as I am a deep sleeper, but I don't mind and it has been waking be up in the morning. The back light is more of a green/blue, which is perfect to read the time or other functions in the dark. As with the other posts here I do feel the Adjust button is sometimes hard to press, but I am getting used to that. I just reach over with my thumb nail and press it and it works fine. This watch is Made in China and uses Module 3229 for the extended calender to 2099. Even though I would have preferred the watch to be made in Japan, there is nothing wrong that I can see with this watch in terms of function, fit, and finish. I set the watch to time gov and the DW5600 is exactly spot on accuracy wise. I know it hasn't been long enough for a true accuracy test, but I am impressed so far. I will be putting this watch to the test this summer in Montana and will throw everything I can at it. If it survives summer, we'll have to see how this baby handles a Montana winter :) In all for $40 you can't go wrong with this piece."

The price, features, design, and history make it an awesome piece for any collector. Whether you wear it a few times a week, or daily, it won't let you down. I didn't want a round G-Shock, and I wasn't ready to pay $100+ for a digital watch, so this was the best bet. It's thin and very comfortable to wear. I even sleep in it sometimes. I'm hoping that the strap holds up. I'm sure they make some aftermarket ones, but I like it as is. It keeps time very well. The watch has stayed within a few seconds since I bought it. I love the ability to make the watch beep each hour on the hour. It's full of features and has all the information I could need right on the dial. I'm thinking about giving this watch to my dad and getting the solar version that syncs. It would be the ultimate no fuss watch for daily wear, but for the price....this thing just can't be beat (maybe a Casio Duro?).

But, believe me, this IS the must have watch. It’s perfect. It’s my go to now, despite having an Orient Kamasu and a Citizen Nighthawk, both of which cost 5 times as much as this one. I have a few Timexes, but this is in an absolutely different league quality wise. The Timexes always feel hollow and cheap. I also have other Casios like the World Time (AE1200WH). I used to think that if you had the World Time, you wouldn’t really need a DW-5600E. The World Time is less than half the price and has more features. But this G-Shock is an absolute classic. This is literally the same design and case as the DW-5600C, which was released in 1987! The only difference is that this has electroluminescent backlight (hence the E in the end). The dial is an absolute classic with the blue and golden text. Also, this cheaper $40 square fits me better than the solar $100 GWM5610. I like that one a lot too, but the shorter lug-to-lug on that one means the strap holes are either a tad tight or a tad loose, whereas with this one, there’s a strap hole in the sweet spot. This is truly the only watch you need. No watch ever deserves that statement more than this one."

Easy to set, read, and i dont really care if it gets destroyed at work. I have a few nice and expensive watches, none of which i want to chance sacrificing with a labor job. So this was great compromise.  Nice enough to not feel like an 8 yr old kid, and cheap enough its not a big deal if something happens to it. Looks just like (close enough IMO) to their $100 - $300 models, and i personally think anyone that spends $300 on the “Japanese model“ digital watch like this is just burning their money. I agree they look nicer than this, and may be solar - but Casio makes much better looking watches for that price. Its still gonna be a $300 watch that looks like like a $40 one.  Gonna buy the black “casi-oak” model too - but NOT on Amazon. Sellers here are price gouging - selling them at twice what the actual retail is, so look somewhere else first before you buy that one. Anyway - I choose to wear this one with the watch face on my lower wrist (palm side of hand). Even though its a pretty slim case, it still gets caught on jacket sleeves and backpack straps wearing it face up. Its actually easier for me to turn my wrist to read it this way anyway. If youre looking for a cheap digital watch that looks nice, isnt huge, is comfortable, and isnt childish looking - this is great option."

I liked the Pebble smart watch, just thought it was ugly. I liked the Apple Watch, just got tired of worrying about the $600+ computer on my wrist being charged or getting scratched/too wet. I hunted like crazy for watches. I wanted an automatic so I tried a few Seiko 5's, a Swatch Sistem51. I obsessed over Grand Seikos, perpetual oysters, co-axial Omegas, any watch that NASA deemed durable and accurate enough for space and that's how I began my DW5600 obsession. I always hated G-Shocks. They look like toys. The glossy band finishes and bright colors often found on the newer models just scream ""DUUUUDE"". But this $40 baseline model, modeled after the early G-Shock models, is everything I'll ever need in a watch.  Its design is simple, giving you a glance at the day, date, and time in an efficient use of LCD display screen real estate. The rubberized casing prevents the casual scratches and impacts to the tough mineral glass watch face. For $40 you aren't getting sapphire. No big deal. Throw your sapphire watch out the window of the third floor of a building along with this guy and you'll see which survives. And me, I jump out third floor windows on the daily when I leave my soul crushing day job. As a person with smaller wrists, I'd say the DW5600 is the perfect G-Shock. Other newer and larger models have watch straps that just suffocate my wrist leaving a sheen of sweat hanging out between my wrist and the watch all day. The larger cases often bring more weight to the watch which makes the little nubs under the strap dig into my wrist. Not so with the DW5600, the watch balances itself on the wrist perfectly and has just the right weight to feel substantial and durable while still fitting under a shirt sleeve. Did I mention this watch does 200m of water resistance, anti shock and has been subjected to torture tests you wouldn't even imagine (just check YouTube. A guy strapped his to his bicycle wheel and went for a ride.) Anyway, I obsessed over many a watch. Ultimately, I can't see myself walking around every day with an invisible force field around my wrist trying to protect a Datejust from a random scratch.

My first 5600 survived 28 years.  I thought the GW700 would do the same or better, what with Atomic TIme and Solar Power, oh my.  Like most reviewers have indicated, after about a year and a half the back light (way cool blue) started coming on with minimal arm motion, which drains the battery.  The Solar Power became less and less effective, meaning the bloody watch wouldn't hold a charge, regardless of how much direct sunlight the watch was exposed to.  I'm a soccer referee (albeit in Seattle where sunlight is precious) and often on the pitch from dawn to dusk (which you would think would be enough sunlight to charge the bleeding battery.)  Instead, in the middle of matches, the entire face would go black while the watch communed with the radio signal in Colorado or something, for 10-25 minutes at a time.  ""Ref, how much time to play?""  Uh, I dunno, and run over to an assistant referee and tell him to give me a sign for when the half ends. So I was in the market for a waterproof (it rains a bit in Seattle, eh?), blast proof (G-Shock), low maintenance, relatively accurate watch, with some kind of stopwatch/timer that was easy to use, and built without even a nod to planned obsolescence (Sp?).  You know, kind of like my first G-Shock. 28 years is longer than most marriages these days.  Anyway, I read a blistering review on Amazon from somebody that refocused my priorities: day, date, time, and timer function.  And forget about how easy it is not to have to reset the time when changing time zones or going on Daylight Savings Time.  Forget about Solar Power which only lasts a year and a half.  And forget about way cool blue, that energy-sucking vampire light. Most difficult for me was giving up on aesthetics.  My GW700 came with a black metal band, a low profile round case, a black display, and a raised cool blue metal face guard.  The 5600E ain't changed in years:  grey display, black display numbers and letters, ultra-thin low-profie rectangular box shape, and too many print sizes and colors cluttering up the display, making for an ugly grandfather when seen next to the GW700.  But it works.  Reliably.  On and off the pitch.  I don't need a piece of art on my wrist.  I need a watch with a stopwatch function that works under any conditions."

So I decided on simply getting a new watch, complete with strap, for just a tiny bit more.. I read the reviews first, some pretty scary in talking about non-stainless steel cheapening, or non-functioning (""overly recessed"") buttons or faulty light. I'd say this under oath (and have no vested interest in Casio!) - I've had at least 3 of this exact same model over the past 3 decades or so. All the watches still work, even if a few pins and casings got beat up eventually. Two have had the batteries changed every few years and a new strap once a decade. This watch is virtually the same exact watch in terms of appearance and function. I was concerned if the calendar included the 2010's, but no worries there. Set it right up, tested that buttons and light-feature are working (they are) and the countdown timer too. Just now I set an alarm and it also worked fine, as always.  So that is my experience - an exact-same watch, my ""old friend"" for snorkeling and day-to-day work  - with stopwatch, countdown, and clock all working just fine. As for manufacture, my last one (whose strap and front harness finally broke) was manufactured in Malaysia, and the one before that in Japan. All are marked with the same model # (different factory codes) and this Chinese incarnation is marked ""St. Steel"" rather than ""stainless"" and a few other minor shifts in the back engraving (adding info on the shock casing too). But, so far, wherever it was pieced together or however the parts are procured, this is a standard-issue G-Shock Casio watch, so far exactly the same in appearance and function as my others. The last thing I'd add is about the comments on skin irritation. Well, I've at times ended up with a red or dry patch on my wrist (especially underneath, as I'll flip the watch to see the front when snorkeling/diving underwater). It's a big piece of steel which may get warm (not from battery; from sun or activity), and the steel back and/or buckle is what has sometimes done a number on my skin too. So I give it a brief rest. For the moment (two days constant wear), no irritation, no difference than any other Casio G-Shock. It's true (but no doubt individual) that the watch and band (bulky and metallic as they are) can cause a rash or dryness, ""for some of the people some of the time"", but I'm only one person. I don't think it's that common or so big a risk for most people. I wear this watch 24/7 (as it can shower or swim with me and I'm not connected to a phone). Love it still. Time will tell, but so far, so good!"

Looks slick on the wrist, good basic functionality with no frills, comfortable enough to wear as a daily watch. I say comfortable ""enough"" because I find the strap to be slightly uncomfortable on my own wrist (I'd give the strap a comfort rating of 7.5 or 8/10). However, keep in mind that the watch is new, and because I just started wearing it, I want to give the band some time to mold a bit to the shape of my wrist. That might improve my comfort rating (and if it does I'll give this watch 5 stars as well). Other than this minor issue with the strap, this watch is great. I don't wear bulky watches and what I really like about this G-Shock is its conservative size: it fits great on my smaller wrist. Not too big, not too small. I can wear this watch with confidence with anything, like t-shirt and jeans or with a suit and tie. Some highlights: - Classic timeless design that I really love. - Time, day, day of the week are all displayed on the main screen. - Current time is displayed in both the stopwatch and countdown timer mode. (Great to be able to see the actual time while I'm jogging.) - Has one alarm that will ring for 20 seconds. The volume is not very loud but no weak either. (Loud enough for me.) - The top left ""Adjust"" button is recessed. Many people (especially those with larger hands and fingers) report having a hard time pressing this button. (Not a problem for me.) - Bright light. - Keeps accurate time. - Solid build quality. If you're looking for a great looking basic digital watch, this is a great choice.  If you're looking for a watch that gives you more functions, get a different watch. I needed a simple but solid watch that delivers accurate timekeeping. I also needed a stopwatch feature to time my jogging routines. That's why I chose this model. Glad I did! --------- UPDATE: November 20, 2014 - I'm still enjoying the watch. But keeping it at 4 stars due to my continued discomfort with the wrist band. The strap is noticeably uncomfortable on my wrist...even a bit more so than when I first got the watch. I'm downgrading my rating of the wrist strap to 5/10. I plan to get a more comfortable strap for this watch (one that makes my wrist feel like I'm not wearing a watch)."

I purchased one recently directly from Amazon and here is what I found. The good: Yes, it is a G-Shock, it does have a comfortable strap, it fits a medium sized wrist very well, it has a low profile (easy to wear a long-sleeved shirt over the watch), and the medium font size is easy to read. The very bad: The watch is overpriced at $75 (retail). This watch should retail for $35 due several issues.  The four control buttons are a joke, the mode button is unusable (required a pen tip or the like to operate), the other three buttons are nearly unusable, they are not user friendly at all. The green backlight is not bright enough. Also, the display/glass does not appear as clear as another Casio watches I own. I would expect this watch to be durable and last for years if not decades like my 28-year-old Casio DW290-1V. After owning both and comparing both side by side I wish Casio would combine the good features from each watch to make a great watch. Simply combine the blue backlight, display glass and the control button action/size from the DW290 onto the DW5600E case/strap, I would pay over $75 for that watch. Included are side by side pictures of my DW5600E (purchased in October 2022) and my DW290 (purchased in October 1994). The DW290 has a new replacement case and band, but the display, internals and case back are original to the 1994 watch."

Band is short.","I've been wearing this style of watch for approximately 15 yrs.  It is much more durable than the Iron Man or similar watches.  I work in a physical environment and it has taken all the punishment I could give it.  I have also worn the watch while covered in mud, snowboarding, scuba diving and all kinds of other outdoor, hot, cold wet and/or rough activities.  Again, the watch keeps working great.  I also like that it constantly displays the day of week and date on the main display.  I also like that it does not have a lot of useless display items that distract from the time/date.  It may not be a ""fashion"" watch, but for the money it’s most reliable and durable watch you will find. Downsides - The battery will usually last about 3 yrs.  When you change the battery it is difficult to reseal and maintain the waterproof integrity of the watch, be very careful taking it apart and putting it back together, don’t tear or install the o-ring wrong or it will leak and the watch will be destroyed. Only other issue is the watch band.  It holds up fine for a year or two, but then the rubberized band can start to crack where the buckle tongue sticks through.  This is why I eventually had to buy this watch...  I tried to buy replacement bands, but they are almost half the price of a new watch and the replacement band reviews all seem to indicate that they are all ""almost"" like originals, but shorter or don’t fit quite right (my old G-Shock is 4 yrs old and still on the original battery so I figured I would just get a new watch and not have to change the battery soon) and the reviews.  So I bought this watch, and guess what... the band is a full inch shorter than my old watch!  Very frustrating.  I can wear the watch, but it is hook on the next to last hole, but this barely allows the watch band tail to be tucked under the retaining loop.  I don’t know whey they are now making the bands shorter, I can only assume that Casio is trying to save a few pennies on rubber... Because of the shorter band I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5."

The 5610 has tough solar and is radio-controlled. But are these features really necessary? With tough solar, you don't have to worry about the battery. The multi-band radio makes the watch always accurate. But with these features come hassles: you have to wear the 5610 properly to expose it to light; but you can't expose it in direct sunlight for too long or leave it on the dashboard of a car. What would you do with a 5610 on a beach in a sunny day? With 5600, you just don't have to worry about anything.

One for myself and one to give as a gift. Almost three years later these watches are both in great condition. I'm very hard on my watches, and almost every watch I have owned in the past has been broken through normal daily use within a year. This is usually due to me accidentally smashing the screen into something, or from an impact due to it being dropped. This watch has survived three years, and it still looks like new. Pros: Incredibly durable - This thing has been dropped, scraped, slammed, and thrown, but it's survived everything that I've thrown at it. Perfect size - Some of the watches on the market today look like you are wearing a wall clock on your wrist. This watch is perfect. It's big enough to read, but small enough that it doesn't look odd. Nice feature set - This watch has a nice basic set of features. It doesn't have any of the more advanced features like atomic time keeping, solar, etc. However, this means that the price is low, and the battery life is much longer. So far I haven't had to replace the battery after three years. The watch face is recessed into the watch - This for me is a huge plus. I've always had an issue with other watches getting paint on the crystal due to me accidentally scrapping them against painted walls. With this watch the screen is recessed into the body of the watch so any paint is transferred to the outer casing. This is easy to clean off, and keeps the watch screen looking great. Cons: I can't find a perfect hole in the watch band for my wrist. I fall somewhere between two holes on the wrist band. One of the holes is too loose, and the other is too tight. However, this is most likely a personal issue, and I do prefer my watch to fit a bit looser then most. Overall I am very happy with this watch. I recommend that anyone looking for a durable digital watch to give this one a look. In the future I want to try some of the other G-Shock watches available, but for now this one is perfect for my needs."

Since I'm getting older I decided to get a classic time piece from Casio, you can't go wrong with the 5600 series.  Very simple design with all the basic functionality of a digital watch. I'll start off with the fitment.  If you have a small wrist this would be the ideal G-shock for you.  It doesn't look like a clock on your wrist like some of the other trendy G-shocks out there.  The watch is very light weight and the strap doesn't seem to irritate or get in your way if wore a long sleeve over it. Functionality of the 5600 is basic, keeps accurate time, has alarm, timer, back lit, count down, military time and tells you the date.  If that is all you need then this the watch for you.  Setting the watch is pretty straight forward, no need to read the manual.  I did get stump on setting the day but if you set up the year probably that will solve the problem.  Watch is very easy to read but then again my vision isn't bad.  The back lit lights up the whole screen not like some of the other G-shocks I own. Although I haven't had this watch long enough I can say that this watch is tough like any other G-shock.  I workout 5 days a week, work on cars, cook, and pretty much everything in between and this thing still looks new.  I will follow up on the review once I reach the 1year mark which I think is critical. Overall I'm happy with my purchase.  I do regret not investing a little more and purchasing the model above this one.  I think its the 5610.  I like the feature of having solar powered and atomic clock however paying twice as much at the time I didn't think it was worth it.  I did deduct 1 star but not because of the product, shipment took longer than I expected.  Not a big deal, so get get yourself one already!"

Update: after eight months of owning this watch I upgraded my rating from four stars to five stars. After decades of catching the bargain casinos (they work great) on sale for around 20$ I finally upgraded to an affordable G-Shock. No noticable scratches and the band is holding up just fine. I bought three and returned two I liked this one the best. I just ordered a 6900, we'll see how that goes. The other two were 9052 variety similar to the 6900, but the 6900 is supposed to fit better. This is my favorite watch, it has the perfect balance of bulk & comfort close to perfection. I liked the bulkier 9052 but it was no where near as comfortable, the only advantage was the light button front and center. The 6900 is going to have a tough time replacing this as my favorite watch, doubt it will happen, Absolutely great and closest I've seen to perfect (for me) watch."

The plastic outer case finally started to deteriorate... and oh yeah I tore or lost the strap retaining loop about 10 years ago (no big deal just put on a tie wrap and kept on wearing the watch). To put this in context, I use my sport watches for sailing, boating, diving and snorkeling (usually in salt water) ...and most other watches have lasted only 2-3 years.  The amazing thing is that I never replaced the battery on this original Casio G-Shock -- it just kept working until the casing finally went. Only slight disadvantage for sailing races it that it doesn't have a synch feature for interim starting signals.  But other than that all the functionality that you really use is there *and* you don't have to read the instruction manual to figure out the watch... user interface and buttons are straightforward and obvious. Classic bulletproof sport watch -- highly recommended.  I'm searching for a yellow one just like my old one, and will buy it immediately if/when I find it (may have to settle for black though). One other thing -- I'm a lefty and unlike other watches, on the Casio G I never had a problem with accidentally tripping the buttons -- as is common when you wear a watch on your right wrist (reaching up and back with your hand can press the watch buttons against your upper arm and on some watches this causes a button-press). ********************************************************************* Update based on over four years with my ""new"" Casio G-Shock -- When I wrote the review above about my old original yellow Casio G, I wondered whether the then-currently available G-Shock would really be as bulletproof as the 1980's original... glad to report that my now 4 1/2 year old ""new"", black Casio G is running just fine, still on its original battery, and having had more use and abuse than the original in the same time-frame (including plenty of saltwater immersion).  What a rare product -- one that was great when it first came out and appears to live up to that legacy in every respect 25+ years later. ********************************************************************* Update at the 7 year mark with my ""new"" Casio G-Shock -- watch is perfectly fine (daily use), but as of March 2015, the band cracked on one side at the usual adjustment hole, so I've ordered a new band -- readily available on Amazon for the DW5600E and currently priced at $17."

It's simplistic, incredibly durable and a no nonsense time piece. My old man wore the original for years and I wanted one exactly like his. Albeit it's a tad different. A true test of durability........the band broke when I was shoveling snow and I lost it in a snow bank. About 4 months later, in the spring. After the snow melted, I found my watch along the side of my driveway. It was still working. It sat outside for about 4 months in a Minnesota winter. And if you know anything about Minnesota winters, it get extremely cold. Like 30 below cold. It worked for another 5 or 6 years on the same battery after that. It won't win any beauty contests but neither will I. So I don't really care what it looks like. It'll survive anything you will survive. And probably through things you wouldn't survive. 24 yrs on my wrist nearly every day and the other day I noticed that the light and the alarm have quit working. Still keeps time just fine but I work midnights so both those things are pretty important. I just saw that they make this watch in a solar model. That will be next one.

I even set up a return for the first new watch I had received, because I thought it was defective.

I really love them. I bought this watch because of the great ratings it had received and it was only $40. I  normally use a GWM850-1cr for the atomic /solar features to keep time dead on everyday. Im a medical courier and i need to have exact time especially for clocking in because we have only a 1 minute window to swipe our cards, also it helps me keep on track as far as my route.  This batch of watches are  2011 models and i found out the batteries last more than 2 years so when i got it, it was very easy to replace the battery.  since i received the watch on feb 19th 2013 I have been checking  it against the atomic watch i have and in 20 days it has NOT lost or gained one second. this is by far the most accurate non atomic watch ive ever had and ill be turning 45 this year. It has a great  24 hour timer, a multifunction alarm that i really like because it has such versatile settings and it works everyday. This watch also features a bright green back light , 200meter water resistance, a stop watch and a very nice thin rugged design that gives me the assurance it wont break even if you abuse it. I think the only con is the adjustment button takes a little getting used to because it is seated a little deeper than it should be. I love the watch so much im wearing it everyday now. i would recommend it  to anyone without reservation .its just a plain simple, easy to operate g shock watch  that you would have to out right abuse to  tear  it up so it gets 5 stars from me.

I was able to set it up without referring to the manual, with just a few functions like split time etc that might need a bit of study.  Thank you to Amazon for selling it to New Zealand, most Casios are off the menu here, and we have to pay ridiculous prices.  But your price is good value.  This might not be perfect - my W 215H has a clearer screen for example - but one look and you know everything you need to know.  No fancy altimeter or barometer, or digital compass, or anything else that can go wrong and put you in danger.  Anything I can possibly imagine doing, and many others besides, I know this watch will take a beating and be there for me. But... I have to admit, since the arrival of my Casio W800HG, that little rascal has hardly ever been off my wrist.  It is smaller and less noticeable than the DW5600E, but has the same sort of presence, and the gold accents make it stand out visually.  I still can't get over the fact that my watch tells me what year it is!  The alarms work well, the buttons are easy to press (unlike the DW5600E), and it is so comfortable I wear it like a second skin.  I just leave it on and wash around it.  There is a 10 year battery so I have no qualms about checking the time in the dark whenever I want.  It has survived numerous unintended impacts without scratches or damage.

I bought him two G-shocks, and he religiously alternates them day to day - so this G-Shock has been worn at least 182 days a year, times four, or roughly 730 days.  What is amazing, is both G-Shocks, including this one, look darned near like the day I bought them.  My other son (his twin brother) also has two G-Shocks of different design with the same result - both look like new, still working with no battery changes needed.  Plus, we are talking about boys now going on 17 years old, so they wore these from the ages of 13 to 17 - tough years for any watch, and the G-Shocks passed the test with flying colors. My son picked this for its basic, classic look.  I love it for the same reason, it takes me back to the days where G-Shocks did not come in 500 shapes, designs and colors.  This is the classic design and look, and that appeals to my son (and me).  This does not have all the fancy features like more expensive models - no temperature, no barometric pressure - but it tells time, and fits on the wrist without getting in the way.  Don't get me wrong, we have all in one watches that DO have fancy features (I personally own two Suunto, Garmin, Mudman and more) but the purpose of this G-Shock was something simple and elegant. I give G-Shocks the highest recommendation.  Kid tested, they keep ticking and looking like new for years and years.  They are literally bomb proof.  Oh, and I own two Mudman G-Shocks myself, and love them.  Same deal - they just keep working!!! THanks for reading."

Nothing fancy just need to be able to tell the time and date. This is slimmer than the other G-Shcok options so it sits comfortably on my wrist and when I bend my wrist it doesn't dig into my hand. It also doesn't make a weird bunch up effect when I have to wear something with a cuff. But why the three stars? Well it is the ""Adjust"" button. It for some reason is recessed well into the watch. I'm guessing this is a factory defect because I don't exactly see the reason why it would be set so deep into it. I only adjust the thing twice a year so I don't see this as being too much of an issue but it does interfere with some of the functions like the alarm and stop watch. It doesn't completely stop me from using them but for those with sausage fingers (such as myself) it makes it a chore to use it. For the price I paid, I'd like some better quality control, so that's two stars subtracted. I'm not going to tell you to not buy one of these because it is a solid time piece but I'm an honest guy and this is an honest review."

I originally used it for SCUBA diving as the timer used as a dive timer was excellent and it did get to 130' and it kept ticking...so it is waterproof and at least to that pressure though I don't know about testing it to 330 meters! Every one has performed flawlessly.  The reason for replacement was that after so many years the rubber casing disintegrated or tore away...no issue there. These watched took a beating in gardens, gyms, diving, fixing cars...you name it. I usually replaced the battery once in a 3-5 year use before I had to release the watch. I did buy one of the camo style G shocks at Christmas this year and returned it...Couldn't see the display and while it looked cool, it was useless for its intended purpose. This G shock has all the right functions that you may want and are easy to use.  Favorite feature is the backlight which you can actually see compared to other watches. I love the stopwatch feature using it regularly.  The alarm is easy to use and loud enough to wake me up without being annoying. Casio used to have a double clock feature so when in another time zone you could set it...guess it was too expensive to add or not thought to be of value.  So, I like the time display, stop watch, timer feature.  I don't use the countdown often, although it is helpful if doing some cooking or something like that.  The watch is the correct size and is unobtrusive.  If you want to show ""bling"" get something else, this watch does its functions flawlessly.

Like it or not, it is as every bit iconic as Rolex Submariner and Cartier Tank, though I doubt its die-hard fans hardly care to make that comparison.  They are fiercely loyal to the watch for its own merits and rightly so.  It’s rugged and functional with nostalgic good looks and a clean, well-laid out face that is free from all the 1990s Pontiac body molding add-ons that clutter so many other G-Shock designs. And there’s something comforting about this watch.  The design has been around a long time.  When you wear it, you feel that you’re wearing something special, something with pedigree.  I guess some might scoff at that, but the revolutionary role of quartz in the history of horology is undeniable. And how many other groundbreaking designs from the quartz explosion are still in production? Is it the best sports watch out there?  No, I don’t believe so.  Timex Ironman has a more intuitive layout for athletes.  Timex’s 150 lap and 250 lap tap screen Ironman Sleek offerings are about as good as I believe you’ll get in a non- GPS runner’s watch with its enormous face and interval timer flexibility.  However, I always think twice before taking an Ironman in the water—never with a G-Shock. So should you buy it?  It’s largely a matter of taste.  It’s certainly affordable enough, robust enough, and functional enough to justify the purchase.  But the design can be a little polarizing.  Frankly, I love it, but I have a nostalgic attachment to the watch and nostalgia can be a powerful thing.  Try one on and if it speaks to you, go for it.  You’ll have to trust your gut on this one.  You either get it or you don’t."

I've done a lot of research on this watch and with almost of a month of wear I am ready to give this a solid review. I saw a need for a wrist watch in my life so I impulsively bought a nice 150 dollar Seiko. I wore it for few days and it did look good, but I felt that I had to be careful each time I moved my wrist. I needed a watch that I could throw on my wrist and not worry about it. I returned the watch and began looking on amazon for a digital watch. I wanted a stopwatch, timer, and alarm. I almost pulled the trigger on a basic Casio that wasn't a G-Shock. I read a review that said ""Not a G-Shock, but that ok!"" and I wanted to see if it really was ok. Boy am I glad I did. This watch has everything I want and performs just a well. I won't repeat what functions this watch has, but I want to mention some things that are not apparent. Most Casio watches have the stopwatch, alarm, and countdown timer function, but they all differ in little things, such as some watches you can set the timer to seconds and other you can only use minutes. Some of the more expensive watches don't show the current time in stopwatch or timer mode. This is a drag! It's really convenient to just leave the watch in a mode and still be able to see the time. With this watch you are able to see the time in all modes except alarm and able to set a countdown timer with seconds up to 24 hours. What more do you need? Its a great watch at a great price that I am sure will last a very long time."

I wrote home and weeks later got what I asked for. A Casio g shock, the same model the I saw many others in my platoon use. It survived thousands of push-ups on pavement, dirt, rocks. It survived low crawling hundreds of meters through thick Georgia brush. It survived all the mud, sweat and moisture and bangs the army could throw at it. Now it's in Afghanistan with me. It's comfortable to keep under the cuff of my OCP uniform. You will forget it's even there. I though about swapping the band out with a nicer one but it's really not needed, it's durable and comfortable. I never take it off, wear it in the shower and never had an issue. Before deploying I swam in the ocean with it and worked fine. If you need a watch that can survive any life style this is the one."

Not only has the DW5600E been around for decades, but the design and functions have remained mostly unchanged. It's a tough watch that's comfortable to wear and will handle just about anything you'll encounter day-to-day. It's a no-frills watch for sure, with a few functions that give you just about everything you need (12/24 hour time and date display, backlight, timer, stopwatch, daily alarm, etc) and nothing you don't. With 200M of water resistance, you can also swim/shower with the watch on and not worry about it. The only gripe I have with this model is that the ""Adjust"" button is a little difficult to press at times. The button has been recessed so it's almost flush against the watch housing. I did some research and found out this is done intentionally to prevent the button from being pressed unintentionally. It's a minor complaint though. For $40 or less, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a watch with as much durability as the DW5600E. Recommended!"

JAPAN does offer that one in a special edition (Must be ordered from JAPAN) but it cost's $300 now rather than the $40 I paid for mine in 1988... The second one I owned lasted 10 years and it was the newer type with screws. Not as water tight as the original and not as high quality but still decent and holds up to abuse. It eventually finally died at 10 years. So I'm on my third one now. The newest one seems slightly more accurate gaining less time than my last model so that might be an updated chip or just luck. I ordered this basic one after looking at the model that goes for around $100 which has solar power and atomic clock sync. But after reading reviews on that upgraded model a lot of people have stated they need to leave that model on the window sill to sync with the atomic clock at night due to weak signal and the solar charging seems to quit at about the 10 year point and that's what these new G-Shocks seem to be good for life-wise about 10 years so might as well go for the much less expensive basic model at under $40,"

I have been buying Casio G-Shock watches since 1982, when I first started diving in the Virgin Islands.  I had a couple of other diver's watches before, but they always seemed to develop leaks.  I bought one similar to this in St. Thomas and never had any more problems.  It is supposed to be good down to 200 meters.  I can't vouch for that, but I have had it as deep as 120 feet a number of times in the VI, Hawaii, and Australia, and it survived them all.  That watch lasted until the mid 90's, when the hard plastic started to break down and come off, but it still kept on ticking (actually, until about a year ago, and I think it only stopped because the battery died).  I should note that I am hard on watches.  It addition to diving, water immersion was always constant as my job entailed fish culture.  They also take a beating physically.  I replaced it and it's successor lasted until a couple of weeks ago, when it actually died at 14 or 15 years of age (not the battery this time). The batteries all had extremely long life, at least three or more years.  My only complaint about the last watch was that it gained a second or two per day.  The watch has a lot of useful features which I will not go into.  I did have to replace the band every two or three years. It is my fervent hope that the watch that I just bought lasts as long and performs as well as my previous ones."

I recently got a job my first job and thought it would be good to keep track of time easier with a watch instead of reaching in my pocket all the time. I looked around and read this is a basic model that is sturdy and will last in my job. Does what I need, more than I need with the countdowns and stop watches. I like how it has pre-programmed dates that I used to have to change if the month didn't hit 31 on previous watches. Comfortable enough, I can feel some edges in the straps but they're not cutting in or anything. I thought it would be a large watch and be sort of encumbering but even while working I forget it's there and is a good size. The information says ""accuracy of +/- 15 seconds per month"" not sure exactly how that's measured but I synced it a couple of times with my computer and it actually gets ahead or behind 4-5 seconds in a day. I don't know if it loses some on one day then gains it back the next, but right now it seems to be a lot less accurate than that. I don't need the accuracy that much but it would be nice if my watch was more true to what the information says. I would definitely recommend this watch to anyone who needs just a base, sturdy watch with no crazy features. 11/28/22 Edit: The battery just died within the last day or two.

Nothing to say at this point that hasn't already been said by the 600+ other reviewers other then personal testimonials, pretty much.  As so many others have affectionately said, this watch has ""just the basics"" - in a good way!  It's all you need in a watch, and you can change or activate settings or modes easily on the fly. I have fairly small wrists, so in comparing the sizes of G-Shocks this one was the closest to my other watches, and so it doesn't look overly-big.  Subtle yet definitely present.  The design and color look retro-cool, but as another reviewer said, ""bullet proof.""  The backlight glow is also subtle but works very well. Bottom-line: This watch is well-worth the money.  I haven't used it in hardcore ways as many others have (I have a desk job) but when I have gone on camping trips it is nice to have something so reliably-solid but yet so light on my wrist, when we're out hiking with and against the elements.  It worked fine under the water in a hot tub (the backlight looks cool underwater).  It's also good for jogging.  Or if you just feel like wearing a fully-functional watch that doesn't look as pretty as dress watches but has everything you need at a glance.  You truly don't have to worry about the wear-and-tear at all, and that is very nice."

This stems from it being a great value, retro cool looking, and just very practical.  I believe this is the cheapest G-shock you can buy and the one that looks most like the original from 1983.  Despite the price it's water resistant, has an anti-bacterial strap, and is nearly indestructible (ok I haven't actually tested that last part yet).  However, what I'm really enjoying about this watch is that as a timepiece it is so practical.  The main screen shows you the day, date, and time to seconds.  Everything you need is there and it's all so readable.  To top it of the backlight is fantastic so you can get all the same information in the dark.  The only thing that I don't like about the watch is that when you switch out of the basic time mode into one of the other modes (alarm, countdown timer, stopwatch) the four buttons aren't well labeled so you have to remember what each one does in each of the modes.  It's not really intuitive there so I'm knocking it down one star.  That said 99% of the time I just use this as watch and for that it is great."

Perry","20 Jan 2010","5.0","The quintessential G Shock...","I hope this helps anyone who cannot decide which G shock to buy. There are a few hundred different models of G Shock watches out there. I own a few of them, and they are all great. They are all tough as nails, extremely accurate, and are nice looking, especially if you appreciate gadgets and technology. If I had to choose only one model, it would be this one, the DW5600E. It is simple to set, and has all the information you need at a glance. No need to push the button multiple times. It's all there. It makes sense!! It looks nice with everything you wear, and the band is soft, but tough, and very comfortable. (Theres a time, and a place for expensive dress watches.) With the price Amazon charges for this model, you really won't feel bad about abusing this piece, and believe me, it can take it!! Please, do not think because the newer models have atomic/solar, multi-band, blah blah blah, they are better. I will say they are more expensive, and bulkier, but definitely not better. Interesting technology, but gimmicky at best. If you treat this watch normally, and limit the use of the back light, the batteries last 5-7 years or more, very easily. Once the watch is set, it is extremely accurate, and may lose seconds over a LONG period of time. If you want to pay more for new features (atomic) that are not necessary, go for it. I learn the hard way that sometimes less is more. In this watches case, it is. I wear all my G's from time to time, but this one is on my wrist 90% of the time. Once you figure out that this watch makes the most sense, there's no turning back... NASA and the military can't be wrong about this model. Buy one already, you won't regret it! Oh and if you have your eye on another G, go for it!! In the end you'll wish you bought this one..."

This is my first G-Shock.  In the past, I've favored the less expensive and smaller sports model.  I never had one that failed and the battery life was quite remarkable.  Their only weakness was the band which always failed in two to three years.  Sometimes a crack in the band will appear before it breaks.  Sometimes not.  Most recently, the little loop on the band broke, rendering it useless.  Given that the loop is not under any significant ""stress,"" the materials used might be at fault.  I was going to purchase a replacement watch of the same variety (the cost is just a little more than a replacement band), but the latest model of the sports watch did not have a countdown timer, a feature that I really value.  (I fly quite a bit and like to set the countdown timer at the beginning of my trip to keep track of the flight time.) I've had this model for about 3 months and have been very satisfied with it.  It gains about 10 seconds per month, but it is relatively easy to reset.  The band is sturdier than the band on the sports model, but I suspect it will fail before the battery needs to be changed based on some of the previous reviews.  It's easy to read, has all the basic features I need, and is not as bulky as I expected, even on my small wrist.  It feels very comfortable, no less so than the model I have worn in the past. All in all, it's a solid performer."

I read the Perth,Astralia ""personal perfect watch"" review and heard about how that guy had purchased all the expensive top of the line models and I realized that makes sense, this simple one has all the featured I'd need, is fantastic price.  It's reliabel, awesome, just like the review said, fantastic interface.  It's a ""junk free"" watch.  No superfluous alarms, It operates exactly how woudl expect a watch.  And I don't expect a watch to have a helicoptor pop out of it and be able to cook dinner!  IT tells the time, has a chrono, countdown, alarm (impressively that can be set at ANY date and time, like I can set a monthly alarm, or an alarm for say 3:03 pm December 02 or some precise date and time which i don't recall ever seeing before on a wristwatch.  Not sure how much I'll use that, but if I do, I'll prob heed the alarm more instead of wondering which random alarm I forgot to turn off is going off? The only other features I'd like on it would be accurate temperature (this is rare on watches though because of body temperature, so I don't expect it) lunar would be a nice touch with sunrise sunset, but again those could be a headache possibly and may not be ideal. Vibration alarm I also REALLy like and would like to see that on this.  But basically zero complaints. marvelous little durable watch. simple and efficient!"

Weed","28 Feb 2014","5.0","A Reliable Old Friend!","This, for me, is the quintessential G Shock watch. Simple to operate, cheap to own;  I was able to completely get it squared away in a couple short minutes without looking at the docs. Just like the last one and the one before, I expect it to last at least 5 years or so. The watch gets scratched eventually--since I won't baby it--and the EL light will grow dim, and finally the watch band gets stiff, and might even break. Along the way, a battery or perhaps two (self-installed) will keep everything humming. Additional bells and whistles available on other models, the solar, the setting the time, etc. are for me merely gimmicks, and truly unwanted. They all add greatly to the cost and complexity, while for me reducing the enjoyment that is a cheap watch. That's what makes this watch so great. It can be used, or heavily abused, your choice. No worries. I have yet to outright break one. They have all lasted for years, and keep excellent time--less than 15 seconds a month variance at worst, and typically not even that. It will never impress anyone, regardless of model, so you forget that. It will keep accurate time and date through rain and snow and mud adventures of your lifetime. Join me and this watch at the start of The Great Divide Mountain Bike Route (and Race!) this second Friday in June, 2014 in Banff, Alberta, Canada. Have fun, make lots of memories! Bottom line: Has all the useful features without a cluttered dial of half-filled lcd circles that mean nothing. Big enough to read even w/o reading glasses, a plus!"

I've heard there are some out there pushing 40 years old that still work great. Can't beat the durability of this watch for the price. Pairs nicely with a NATO/Zulu strap, and with the bull bars sold here on Amazon it will put up with reef/wreck/cave diving bumps and scrapes, and it looks pretty cool with them too. Timer and stopwatch are great for low-tech diving or old school dive planning as well.

Fortunately Amazon returns are pretty painless so I'm thankful for that. The watch contains the usual functions:  time, date, count down, stop watch, alarm, back light.  They all seem to work OK.  So it gets 3 stars. The watch is adequate but nothing really stands out.  There was nothing that rose above the $15 Timex I was replacing. Pros I have a pretty big wrist and the band was plenty large. Cons. First, the reason I returned it.  All the buttons are difficult to push.  They are recessed somewhat and I found that they did not work by just pushing my finger on them as you typically do.  I had to angle my finger or go at the button with the edge of a fingernail to work it.  I guess some might count that as a pro as there is no way these buttons are going to be triggered accidentally.  I think I would have lived with that if it weren't for the top left button.  That's the button you use to get in to setup.  It is also the button you use to get in to the countdown settings and to reset the countdown or stopwatch.  I could not operate that button except by pushing it with a slim object.  I don't know whether this was defective or by design.  If it was just the original setup I would have lived with this but I use countdown timers a lot and couldn't live with finding something to push the button to set the countdown.  So back it is going. Although the button issue was the killer, there were a couple other features that I did not like. Like some other watches I've had (but not all), when you are in setup or perhaps setting a countdown, the is only an 'up' button.  So if you overshoot your minutes, you have to roll all the way around again.  Some other watches used the other button on the same side as a down button so if you over shoot, you press 'down' a couple times and you're done. The display itself is smaller than I expected, but that's probably a personal choice.  I don't think it is as obvious in the picture, but when I actually got the watch, the bulk of the watch over powered the display.  It was not difficult to read but would have been better if the display and numbers  were larger. The backlight seemed to turn off too quickly for my taste. as I only had this for about 1/2 hour, I can't really comment on the ease of use or how well it wears day to day."

I have worn the model with the vibration alarm for many years as my beater/workout/weekend, etc watch and really like the features it has.  Especially the vibration as you can 'silently' be notified of an alarm or your countdown timer without the high pitched beeping.  I've been considering the DW5600E-1V for a few months as I was wanting something a bit smaller that also provides the water resistance and like that it has the additional shock protection.  The biggest adjustment has been to the small buttons used to make the adjustments.  While I understand the principle of having them recessed a bit so they don't accidentally get pressed, I believe they could have made them stick out another millimeter (especially the ""A"" button, the one that allows you to enter the adjust mode) while not affecting the protection of accidental button pushing.  I do like the size of the case but kind of wish the light was a different color than green...but that's just my preference and something I have to get used to.  Like many people have stated on several different reviews, I would have liked to have an easier method for changing out straps without having to purchase adapters. But, at least I have some options!

Jahn","12 Nov 2015","4.0","Great watch for active individuals.","I had this exact watch for my trip down to Costa Rica.  (The adjustment hole that I used all of the time eventually wore through after a couple of years.  Although the band can easily be replaced, I lost my Casio and have since bought another, because I really like this watch) This is far and away the most affordable watch with 200m water resistance rating.  It's accurate and very functional.  I specifically like and use the count down feature.  I also like how the day and date are displayed on the main clock screen. PROS: I don't really use my watch alarm feature all that much, but it is easy to use and functional when I have used it. I use the countdown timer all the time for cooking, rest between exercises when I am working out etc. The stop watch feature is excellent and goes up to 24 hrs.  It gives minutes seconds and 1/100s of a second, so it is incredibly accurate. It is a large watch, so just be aware.  But I love the old school look. CONS: If you have fat fingers, the adjust button may be hard to press. The illumination light could stay on for a tad longer. SUMMARY: Great functional dive watch.  Indestructible.  Fairly large and bulky (again, I like that look).  I would definitely recommend if you are in need of a tough and functional sport watch."

He missed and hit the concrete but that's besides the point. Before that point this watch had been buried in mud, sand, taken in the ocean many times and slammed against the ground by my arm (accidently). This watch is the toyota 4runner of watches. It is a great value, supremely capable, ugly in a cool masculine way, and cheap enough to not give you gray hair over scratching it. It is everything an apple watch is not and I love that. As opposed to overprice innovation this watch is unadulterated bare to the bones solid construction and the embodiment of ""if it ain't broke dont fix it."" Buy this watch. It is the perfect blend of quality construction and durability and a price that makes this relatively disposable compared to all those GPS weather predicting BS sensing high tech computers other people wear on their wrists these days.

I've been using smart watches since the Pebble Kickstarter funding campaign but it was only recently I understood that instead of making my life easier, smartwatches were just another complication I could very well do without. The DW5600E is as basic as a watch can be while still maintain the same ruggedness and durability for which  the G-Shock watches are famous. It's not an overly large monstrosity as the G-Shock I used to wear in the army and it fit comfortably on my wrist. There are functions for stopper alarm and timer but who really needs it on a watch when we all have a smartphone can perform these functions better? So let's summarize: It an almost unkillable watch that displays the time and the date accurately and you really don't need anything else beyond that in a watch."

I haven't had is long but it feels very well built and is one of the few things I've ordered that looks better in person than it did in the pictures. All graphics and text are very crisp. This watch has everything I need for the gym/jogging and shouldn't be phased by years of sweat. The resin band also shouldn't stink to high heaven like my last gym watch with a cloth band. Unlike my last gym watch, this Casio is stylish enough to wear out and I often opt for it instead of my heavier, metal watches. I don't have very large wrists and imo this looks so much better on my wrists than the larger G-Shocks. This is my first Casio and the controls are all very intuitive. So why only 4 stars? The pushers. They work, but they are more difficult to press than Timex watches I've owned. Not a deal breaker for me, but worth noting. I will say you do get used to them, but there is no getting around the fact that they aren't as easy to use as many sport watches. I get that the pushers go with the overall retro look of the watch, but if they had used pushers that protruded maybe half a mm more, they would have had a nearly perfect everyday watch."

Super light, easy to use, simple and it seems strong enough.  We shall see on this last one.  I never take my watch off and I surf all the time so it will take a beating.  I will report back in a year.  Highly recommended! Here is my review for the mudman which I returned: This watch is defintly everything that the write up says it is. Super rugged and it has all the features. One thing I hated about it was the size. I felt like I had one of flav a flavs giant clocks on my wrist. I have a medium sized wrist and it just looked kind of ridiculous. If you are used to giant g shocks this wont be a problem but I didnt like it at all. Also, the display is tiny. I am sure this watch will last forever though. Just make sure you know what you are getting. UPDATE************* After having this watch for 4 months I would say it is an excellent and durable watch for surfing, working out, and daily use.  In fact, I left mine on top of my car after a surf session and drove off so I just bought another one.  I love it UPDATE 2 >>>>>>>> Perfect surf watch.  Its been 2 years and the thing is still rolling no probs although the band has one hole ripped open---you put a lot of strain on your wrist and a watch when you surf so I am not surprised the band finally ripped through but my cheap butt just moved one notch down.  Enjoy!"

My 2nd G - Shock finally died on me Nov 2016 which started my hunt for an identical replacement.  You can imagine my disappointment when the clerk at a watch store told me it was not the battery and they discontinued this version :).  I was finally able to find it on Amazon.com and for an amazing price.  My watch collection includes a Tag Aquaracer and Breitling Super Ocean but consider through years of rugged usage the G - Shock 5600 my all time favorite.  Not only does it look and feel like a New England Patriots 4x Super Bowl Champion but it is durable and almost impossible to kill.  My last one withstood a beating on land, air and sea plus a tour in the Marine Corp the battery lasted well over 20 years and it kept perfect time.

I have small wrists so I found other G-Shock models not very likable. This watch fits perfectly though and the retro look of the watch makes it extremely stylish. This watch doesn't have advanced features like other G Shocks, but I just need all the basic features; time, date, alarm, timer, stopwatch. Also the fact that the watch is a matte finish rather than a glossy finish is great for those who don't enjoy scratches on their watch. Time looks very clear both at night and daytime. To add, the watch is extremely light, which is a plus. Though I'll probably never wear this watch while swimming or near water activities, its great knowing its essentially water proof. I've been looking for a good looking yet affordable digital watch and it seems I have found it. If your looking for a smaller G Shock rather than the huge ones you found your perfect match. Though I had love at first sight with this watch, I found a small grayish scuff on the left side of the bezel where ""Protection"" and ""G Shock"" is located upon examination after opening it. I will be exchanging it with a new one through Amazon and will update my review once that is complete. I'll put how my exchanging process was in the updated review. But I'm sure that when I get actually get my ""new"" DW5600, I'll have the DW5600 at 5 stars! I'll probably add more to this review when I get my new DW5600 and have more time with it."

I really love having military time along with the date on the main display, it's very clear and easy to read and the backlight is great for pitch black conditions and is just barely bright enough to use as a flashlight if you're trying to find something in the dark. This thing survived weeks and weeks of Air Force Officer training and has been dragged through the dirt and come out looking brand new. Unfortunately the band has decayed in some spots from being covered in bug spray and sunscreen and god knows what else that has just eaten into the rubber, but that is at no fault of Casio. I haven't taken this watch off in months and shower with it every day and haven't had any problems - I haven't yet gone swimming with it but I would be very confident in it. It has survived rain, mud, dirt, impacts, etc. and aside from the wear on the band as mentioned it looks like it just came out of the box.

After wearing it for a while I have to say it is simply amazing. If you don't care about price or status with your watches and are more about pragmatism and great functional design, it's hard to beat this watch. It's like the Glock 17 of watches. It knows exactly what it is and what it's supposed to do and just does it faithfully. Also, after wearing automatics for so long I can't help but be blown away by the accuracy of this thing. I also like how this particular model is more moderately sized compared to most other G Shocks, so it fits under shirt cuffs easily. If you're on the fence about getting one I'd say just take the plunge - the price is unreal for what you get and you never know when you'll need a low-key near indestructible watch on a job or a trip."

Its battery lasts hundreds of times longer that in a computer-watch, which must be charged every day. This watch is sturdy.  I am always working on things, and it does not make sense to be smashing up a delicate watch.  The Casio model will hold up: it is designed to be rugged.

Simple yet elegant. Unapologetically plastic but durable & rugged. It's a timeless classic. However, I do see a lot of people's video reviews that they always seem to nag about the recessed ""Adjust"" button on the top-left. But the problem is that they always seem to fail to mention why it is as it is. So, I will get this straightened out for you if you're curious. The reason for the recessed ""Adjust"" button is because when compared to other Casio G-Shocks or any other digital Casio watches that does not have a recessed Adjust button, the purpose of it is because it only takes a single click where as the others that's not recessed, you actually have to hold it down for a second for the Adjust button to register. That is the only reason. Nothing else. It is recessed so you do not accidentally press down on it since it only takes a single press to register. You do not need to hold it down for a second unlike the other watches that have a non-recessed Adjust button. Bottom line is; that's all nit-picking. Just buy this watch. Stop complaining. Don't listen to the people complaining about this on their video reviews. Just buy it. You won't regret it."

I beat the crap out of that watch, and I can't ever remember replacing the battery in it. The only thing I disliked about it was the terrible light. If I was to rate that watch now, I would give it a 4 because of the light, but everything else was great.

And the back light is amazing compared to the one on my old G-Shock. But no, there's no dual time like on the old one! As a ham radio operator, having dual time set to UTC was the most convenient thing when operating. So, because there is no dual time, 4 stars again. But an easy to use, bombproof watch nonetheless. As people have said in previous reviews, it is pretty much a chick repellent. That said, I'm getting to the point in my life where a good solid watch is more important than what women think about me, so maybe this isn't really a bad thing."

I had to change the battery twice in 20 years.  I also replaced the band in 2005.  My G shock survived brutal training,  a billion field ops, and two tours to Afghanistan and Iraq each.  It went to the deserts of Africa to the snows of Alaska.  It went to the jungles of Thailand to Death Valley.  It's was dunked in every ocean on earth except the arctic ocean, along with most of the great lakes.  My old rottwieler chewed on it, as did my two dobermans.  I never take took it off.

I have only had it for a week. It there have been no issues so far. It has all the features I wanted. It is larger than I was expecting but then again I have very tiny wrists. I like that the time displays in the upper box even when using the other functions. It takes some playing with to figure out how to use all of the features but as long as you've owned a digital watch and are familiar with how they typically work you should not have a problem. The buttons are a little hard to push which can be seen as a good or bad thing. The upper left adjust button is a bit difficult for me to press because it is somewhat recessed but with a little bit of work I can get my finger in there. It is not a button you should have to use very often but if so I would suggest growing out at least one nail and filing it into a point. I haven't gotten too far with the manual but I am not sure if you can make it so the watch doesn't beep when changing from one mode to the next. I will update this post once I know for sure.

Always have been and grew up in the late 80's. This watch is quite similar to the very first original 1983 GW5000c gshock. Only difference is the absence of the outer red ring, the brick pattern background, and a couple words. The remake high end model of this original comes with a hefty price tag though and it does look a bit closer. However this watch's price is way more affordable and is still almost completely identical. Not to mention it even has a couple other features that resemble the original '89 F91w model. Very good! So if you wore casio digital watches in the 80's(nostalgia) or you want a watch of that effect, here you go! Fits the bill nicely! If you want a variant of gshock that does look even closer to the original 5000, solar powered, under $100 and has that red ring inside the bezel like the original, go with the GWM5610-1."

There are three things in her life which by all counts must absolutely remain constant, they are her toaster, her microwave, and her watch. Well, her watch died. I was charged with the task of finding a watch similar to the one she had from 1980!  Yes, 1980. I searched in stores, I searched online, and I'll be honest... I wasn't amused at the price for this watch. It's plain, basic, and simple, and I feel it should be less expensive than it was. However, this thing was identical to the watch she used to have and that's all I needed. I haven't worn a typical digital watch since I was a kid, I'm in my 40s now... but I was able to pull this thing out of the box and set it without any hesitation; it's just like it was in the 80's.

Have two of them currently. Made in Japan, Thailand and China! They are great, basic watches for every day wear and are durable and capable of taking some ""shocks"" and other knocks. But...battery replacement is kind of a hassle. That o ring that seals everything is prone to get damaged when removing the back plate and parts like the straps and such are expensive when compared to the initial value of the watch. These are almost ""disposable"" types of watches. I change my own batteries and straps as needed and I use these watches on a daily basis but to be honest I finally broke down for the first time in my life and bought a mid level Swiss ""automatic"" watch for dress or casual wear. (no batteries!) Oh, to service the G shock yourself, you need small, watch type screwdrivers and CARE and PATIENCE and a steady hand. Don't lose those screws and try not to displace the o ring or damage it when removing the back plate. To ""initialize"" the battery when you've replaced it, remember to perform the ""voodoo"" procedure--using tweezers or such (conductive metal) touch the ""crosshair"" etching on the battery and the small ""ac"" marked spot on the watch and hold until the watch become active again and then reset your settings."

While common now, this was an engineering breakthrough that we now take for granted. It's a classic versatile design, much more so than newer G-shocks (which I consider the ugly Humvee of watches). No one will likely notice this watch, which is a good thing to me. It's light and comfortable and does what it needs to do. I only wish it had a snooze alarm. I can't imagine that the module with a slightly more complicated program would add much cost. I have to take away a star for quality control. There was a raspy buzzing sound when pressing the buttons because the contact spring was not sitting flush to the case. I had to open it up and reposition it -- but then the issue reappeared.

They take a beating, are great for the gym/travel/working in the mud and sand. I had a Casio databank all through college and law school, and always replaced the resin band with a silicone strap. When my Databank died, I bought a hardy 'no-name' digital in a stainless steel case to replace it. It died when I went 3 feet below water. I wanted a no-frills watch that could handle the gym and business casual wear. This watch is tough, yet unassuming. I was worried about it being a bit too boxy or plain, but it's masculine but without being too utilitarian. The buttons are easy to work and the functions are exactly what you need and nothing less. It's certainly prettier than any other G-Shock IMHO. If you want a digital watch that embodies a 'drop it in the mud and it still fires' work ethic, this is your timepiece. $40 is a great price for it BTW. Only reason for the 4 stars is that I tried to replace the band, but it couldn't go on. I usually don't like the resin material, but it's grown on me. The band really works with the watch face itself, so don't even think about swapping it out with something eye catching (like I stupidly tried to do). I left on the original strap and I feel confident that it will last as long as the watch itself."

Plus it is super durable, well proportioned for most wrists (unlike the other tuna can sized g-shocks), looks great and, to top it off, this watch is approved by NASA for use in space!  Super happy with owning this and am tempted to buy another one as a backup. July 2017 year update - watch is still going strong with no signs of battery fatigue.  Only signs of aging are that occasionally when I push a button it no longer beeps.  This never happened on my previous one (same model that I had for 5+ years), so I am inclined to think this second one is mildly defective. However, the inconsistent beeping doesn't bother me, as the alarm still works 100%.  Second thing is be careful when spraying certain kinds of bug repellent - I used my friend's spray last weekend and it left spots on the resin strap (hard to believe it is ok to spray on skin when it will chemically react with resin!).  Will probably get a new one as I can't stand looking at the part of the strap that looks like it's been dropped in acid, even though functionally this watch is 100% ok."

I was looking for a Casio watch with auto-repeat countdown time, a google search returned this as a watch with this capability. This is my first G-Shock watch. Other things I like about this watch are, i) it's built to last ii) replacement straps are available iii) the buttons cannot be accidentally bumped, my previous watch was notorious for this and most of the time would be displaying the time in another part of the world iv) the backlight is great. v) waterproof, great for surfing and snorkelling Things I'm not so keen on i) the Adjust button (also resets the stop watch and countdown timer)  is so far indented that I cannot push it in sufficiently with my thumb or finger nails. However this is a plus too (see iii above). If I take the watch off, the adjust button can be pressed sufficiently with the buckle on the strap. Overall I'm impressed with the watch, it's converted me to G-Shocks and I expect to wear this one for a long time. I'll be buying more for my kids."

This is really well made. The matt black absorbs light in a way that says it's not just cheap plastic. The crystal remains pristine and scratch free. The watch is light and easy to wear, the band being quite flexible. It's a bit bigger than I imagined, not quite G-Shock big but will still snag on a tight shirt cuff. The value for money is extraordinary. I hesitated to upgrade for atomic sync and tough solar, but that drives the price up more than twice. The whole point of this watch is that it is very simple to keep costs down, and the consensus on watch forums seemed to be that the 10 year battery and the tough solar technology die at about the same time anyway, whilst the former is a lot cheaper to replace. As for atomic sync, it would be nice but I'm always near the internet and it takes literally a second to adjust the hour for a new time zone. I wear this a lot over much nicer and more expensive watches, because it's comfortable and looks neat. I'll reluctantly put on a mechanical watch if I need to meet clients. There's something just great about the minimalist toughness and value for money in this watch. It's philosophically great."

I have had analog watches that I have broken within weeks of purchase.  But this watch has lasted me six and a half years (so far).  I am not a desk jokey - I work a job in manufacturing, which is a fairly harsh environment to put a watch in.  In my free time, I enjoy hiking, the occasional swim, and ultra marathons.  On trails.  Some of which are muddy.  I did not buy this to be a dress watch.  I bought it to survive, and it has done an exceptional job doing so.  I have gotten it wet, I've gotten it dirty, muddy, and I've (unintentionally) bashed it and generally beat it up.  It just keeps going.  While today I did have to repair some of the bezel with industrial strength glue, it only failed because I had somehow managed to put a previous crack in the area.  I haven't even had to change a battery. About the only knock I can give this watch is that the wristband is about ready to go on mine.  But after six plus years of hard use, that's not surprising.  If you are looking for a dress watch, look elsewhere.  But if you are looking for a watch to take on any adventure, or as a daily wearer, this is worth every penny of it's current price.  It's impressed the heck out of me."

Wussow","18 Jun 2020","3.0","Classic with a few headaches","It's a timeless watch, and it's ruggedness is beyond question. I don't doubt it'll take a beating. But there are a couple things that kinda suck. First, a tiny one - the screen is harder to read (more washed out) than other Casio's I own (specifically the World Time). I assume that's due to the tougher ""glass"". On the flip side, the light is better. Second, and a doozy - the adjust button is more recessed than the other four. This is apparently on purpose, as it only takes a tap to enter the mode where you can change the time. (Other Casios, you hold it down for a couple seconds, which seems better to me.) That would be fine except it's so recessed you can't push it. I needed a tool (a pen) to push it. If it were only for changing the time that might be ok, but you also need it to change the alarm, set a timer, reset the stopwatch. Everything uses this unpressable button. In my case, I fixed it by removing some of the outer rubber bezel around that button, which works fine, but you shouldn't need to hack up a new watch so it can work at a minimum level. Form what I've read online, this is a recent change due to a new factory. Pretty disappointing."

When you first handle it, it will appear much smaller than what the online pictures appear but it’s not so much a bad thing because the display is still very clear. The lumination is also excellent and you can make out the time perfectly clear in complete darkness. If you want more info on this watch, YouTube has tons of videos on this model and other G-Shock squares. The next two things I had an issue with are that the display phases out when you look at the display from above and perfectly clear when looking directly or from below at it, which I guess is not so uncommon a thing for certain digital watch displays. The other is the top left adjust button is a little harder to press compared to the other buttons, so as long as your nails are a little long, you’ll have no problem pressing the button. So all and all, this is an excellent value buy if your looking for a solid digit g-shock watch."

Granted, if you are not a special forces sniper, Harvard educated arctic diver with a post-doc in marine microbiological thermal-vent martian life or a U.N. cardiologist with a history of open heart field-surgeries performed at candlelight during the Bosnian War, or perhaps the owner of a Multinational Russian Oil and Gas empire piloting your Carbon-Kevlar-Carbon yacht on the America's Cup, you may not get the expected nod of approval from your significant other when it comes to style.

And this is why I keep my broken Rolex around: To wear once or twice a year when I can't justify the ring around my wrist from wearing my G Sock classic year-round. You will, however, get the most bomb-proof, forget-about-it, dependable piece of timekeeping ever made at a very reasonable price. It will outlast any other watch you have. Guaranteed.

It came today I am wearing it now, it works fine but has the same issues as the last one but this one has a better strap. on the down side this one is put together so poorly the ""adjust"" button is almost not push- able.had to use the tip of a pen to set the watch... the metal button is lower than the plastic rubber of the watch. look in the picture, three silver metal buttons show but not the fourth for adjust. and yes for those of you that cant wait to call me out i know it is inset slightly on purpose to prevent unwanted mishaps, but this ones way too inset. I know how it should be, this isnt my first 5600 frame g shock.  blah.  and just like the first the screen still moves under the crystal when i push any buttons. I realize this old model is not the expensive g shock any more but i jeez g shocks used to have better quality control? i figured one bad one now and then is nothing but two for two.  ive had six g shocks and about 25 casio watches,most all of them were great, not these two. not the sellers fault both showed up on time well packed with everything they should have with them like warranty cards etc.  ill keep this one i guess,  just trash it when the battery dies. watch showed up on time already running in the correct box with all the correct cards etc. it looks like the one i had two decades ago but it dont feel like it. I loved my old g shock but lost it and never found it. bought a new one when the price was right this week, was excited about it. opened it and looked it over and the watch was a little disappointing within just a couple minutes. the quality control for casio must not be what it used to be. the old one i had i remember it being very well made and very tough. on the new watch the strap feels cheap, the buttons are not crisp to push, its no longer metal cased in front but a plastic / rubber that is separate from the watch.  the most disappointing part, while setting time and date i noticed when i push the buttons for the light or start / stop  or in manual speak buttons b and d, the face of the watch moves to the left inside the case and plastic rubber cover overlay even with the slightest pressure on those buttons.  so to explain further, when you push buttons b or d with enough strength to make the button function for its purpose the digits on the face actually shift to the left inside the case and you can clearly see it happen from a normal distance that you would look at the watch to see the time of day from! its moving fractions of an inch but still, it shouldnt at all. the g shock 5600 i had years ago was like a little tank and i played baseball went fishing went to work at labor jobs and more and it held up. this one i suspect will breakdown after about a year if im careful with it. maybe i just got a bad one that slipped by. ive had a lot of casio watches and nearly all of them worked well and lasted longer than the price i paid for them would have justified. its good looking classic watch but im sad in the new build quality."

Just about everything is the same, which is great. The only thing that I’m not thrilled about is the band. Yes, it works fine now. But it seems to be a purpose-built design that cannot be replaced by a standard band. That means that new bands can only be purchased so long as these specific bands are being made. What that means is that the watch’s lifespan is limited by the availability of the band. With my old watch, I replaced bands over and over until I decided to replace the watch itself. That option may not be available for this watch. Of course, for another few bucks I can replace the whole thing, so it’s not that big a deal in the grand scheme of things.

The only thing she didn't like besides the look of the watch was she couldn't read the digital display well.  So, she gave it back to me.  It is simple to operate, waterproof to 200m, very light and comfortable to wear.  It is a good watch to wear with your blue jeans or when working in the yard or whatever.  While I personally like the look of the watch and its simplicity, I gave it 4 stars simply because the digital readout is not what I would call small, but smaller and harder to read than the display on my Solar Atomic GW-500A.

May pinch at your ""wrist hair"" (if you'd say), which to me can be at times a bit of a stinger but no big deal.

Its not the original old school gshock but its pretty much the same thing just different serial number. This gshock is a great investment when it comes to performance and cost. It will take a beating and the battery will last a long time. The only complaint would be that one of the buttons is sunk in and its very hard to press. Besides that I love this watch. The light function works great and makes it very legible at night. Can’t ask for more at a $44 price point."

It’s cheap and durable.","I’ve had many g-shock watches but this one is my favorite. I wear it to work at my job at the hospital, at a retail store and everyday around the house and around town. It looks good and is very durable being a g-shock. I’ve always loved Casio watches and especially g-shocks but the g-shocks can be a bit thick and heavy and can hinder you from slipping your hand in small spaces and pockets. But this one has a perfect profile. It is very lightweight as thin but still has the durability of a g-shock. I dropped it off a 6 foot ladder onto concrete by accident and it wasn’t even scratched. It has good features. It has time, day, date, alarm, time remaining and stop wat h feature. You can also set the alarm to go off everyday at a certain time. It also looks great and can be dressed up with formal attire. I started wearing a Casio f-91w because of the thinness and lightness instead of my other g-shocks but when I bought this it had a perfect balance between size and durability. Great watch love it."

The first one started to fall apart after about 8 years but, despite it's condition, was taken by gunpoint in Mexico City.  My buddy lost his Rolex to the theives.  He felt a lot worse than I did.  When the battery ran out on the second watch I sent it in to have it properly replaced in order to maintain its water resistance.  After that battery ran out I discovered that it's cheaper to buy a new watch than to pay for proper battery replacement.  The battery on my current watch needed replacing after about 5 years and I went to the local jeweler who replaced the battery for about $5, but I now can't wear it in the rain or it will start to fog up.  No diss on the watch, it will be fine if send it to the repair facility for battery replacement but a new watch will cost about the same. This watch gains about two minutes every three months but its not a big deal.  Thank you Casio for continuing to make this fine watch."

The day I received it, I set it EXACTLY to the official NIST time.  Two months later, it is still right on the money TO THE SECOND.  2) G-Shock watches have a reputation for being pretty much indestructible. Though I haven't had a major accident with it yet, I have no reason to believe that this isn't a very durable ""accident-proof"" watch. Nice to know. The bad: 1) Might be just my aging eyes, but I wish the day, date and time numbers were a little bigger, and there was more contrast between the numbers and the background. For me, the watch is perfectly okay under ideal conditions (well-lit room with plenty of time to look at the watch.) But in less than ideal conditions (low light and/or when driving and a quick glance is all you have time for) I find it difficult to read. 2) The light button is recessed and a little difficult to find and press when you need to light up the face. My Timex Expedition is much easier to read but not as accurate or as indestructible.  All in all, though, a very good watch."

You can literally wear it doing anything, although you might want to take it off occasionally to clean it a bit, because it will gather up your sweat and dead skin cells and whatever else you come in contact with. Its a great watch, easy to use, great functions (stop watch, alarm, timer), and tells everything that you basically need to know (time am/pm and military, date, day of the week). Super sturdy and its been an essential for me, I wear it everyday for the most part. In the ocean, in the shower, in the hospital, playing basketball, you don't really need to worry about taking it off because it won't break. In fact you should take it off during basketball because you might hurt someone if you hit them in the face with the watch. It's pretty indestructible, just youtube the tests they put these watches through. It's reliability is part of what makes this watch so appealing. Its durability in combination with its classic design and many functions, its probably the best value watch to go for at its price."

I had purchased the 5600j because I thought that the Solar + Atomic features would be worth the extra +/- [...] or so... In reality, as many have mentioned, those things are nice, but not necessary. This watch is just rugged, timeless, and reliable. Many people have had theirs for years and years and they go strong. I have no reason to expect anything less from this watch. After getting this one in the mail, I went right back to (x) and returned the J. With the J, I felt I always had to be mindful of keeping it around light and trying not to damage or bump it because it is a nice watch after all. The E is my terminator watch. It can go anywhere and I never have to worry about it charging or updating. The Atomic time is available online to sync the watch with every few months anyhow, so that negates the value there. End of story is that everyone should have a 35 dollar watch that they can take to space if the need arises! hahahaha. Buy this watch already. I will note, however, that the side by side comparison of the E and the J proved to be pretty interesting. The J had probably 30% bigger digits, which I liked, but the E seemed to have a wider screen in that there was more room for information on the home screen. I know they are the same size, but I feel the E does the job just fine. A+ watch! Great Price! Thanks Amazon and Casio!!!!"

Years later - I found myself working construction as an electrician and bought another g Shock.

The light stops working before it stops keeping time, so that is a good indicator that it is going.  I got the readily available replacement, and with some instructions I found on line was able to replace the battery myself in less than a half an hour, and it is still working flawlessly.  A few notes on this.  The screws are really small so have the right small screwdriver, and a small container ready so you don't lose them.  You have to loosen the bracelet to get the back off, but it is fairly easy.  Once you put in the battery you have to reset the watch by connecting the battery to a point on the circuit board.  (See directions for this- it is really the only tricky part)  Essentially, you are briefly shorting it to get it to reset.  Once that is done, it works fine, although, of course, you have to reset the time  and date.  Have some silicone grease so put on the gasket so it will remain waterproof. You can, of course send it to Casio, but if you are comfortable taking things apart, and putting them together, this is very doable."

I've worn one ever since, and that's saying something.  I've worn one down to 130 ft off Okinawa and no water got in the watch.  I've had it covered in oil and other fluids while working on my vehicles and it was not damaged.  Supposedly, if I remember right, the buttons can be pressed down to 15 ft but I've never tried it.  Another major plus for me is that the band is long enough.  I have big wrists and very few watch bands are long enough for me.

I've always ended up selling them for one reason or another. For the more expensive pieces I was always worried about getting them damaged during everyday wear and eventually just got tired of worrying. With the high priced automatics also came maintenance and care which would add up as well as constant readjustment (automatics tend to lose or gain several seconds a day) and while they are very cool and mechanically interesting watches, eventually the novelty faded for me and I just stopped caring as much. Eventually I was just looking for a watch that kept time well, was functional and practical, looked good, and one that I didn't have to worry about getting banged up.This watch definitely fit the bill for me. In not implying that this lowly g-shock is ""better"" than a high price automatic (though if you are talking about pure timekeeping performance and functionality, I would say this will beat out most automatics anyday but you really can't compare the two since they are both very different in philosophy) but if you are looking for something that just works and yet maintains a simple yet classic aesthetic, this watch is certainly worth the money."

The Casio 5600E is 30% lighter than its predecessor the 5600C and therefore feels more comfortable on the wrist, although not as collectable. Also the 5600C featured dual time. However, the styling was left unchanged, except for some very minor cosmetic changes with the writing on the face. You cannot perfect what is already perfected. The comfort is simply amazing for a what appears to be a bulky watch. The G Shock has internal dampners installed to provide outstanding shock resistance, including full contact sports, chainsaws, jack hammers, etc, 12 rounds with Mike Tyson and full cage fighting :-) Not to mention skydiving, space missions and scuba diving. Features: Classic Casio 1980's looks, which many people love. 24 hour stopwatch, but...the time is kept displayed, very useful. 24 hour countdown timer, again, with the current time displayed. Backlight, which flashes for the duration of the alarm and hourly time chime & timer. One alarm, not 3 0r 5 0r 19, as some people are annoyed by this, which I find kinda interesting. Extremely comfortable resin band. And of course the Illuminator...bring it on. I could go on all day and night about this watch, or perhaps write a novella on it, or even base my whole life memoirs, that is how much I love this watch, but I won't, for fears of repercussions from my wife, my boss, my friends, and maybe even Casio themselves."

The band practically melted when i left it in my truck on a hot day. So i figured all inexpensive/digital wristwatches were the same. I had seen G-shocks, and thought they were too clunky, but needed an inexpensive beater-type watch, and after reading the rave reviews for this watch, figured to take a chance. After a few weeks of using the watch, I can now say it is my favorite watch to wear. I used to use a black monster Seiko as a daily wearer, but this has now taken its place. First, it isn't an automatic watch. No need for a winder, or to constantly be wearing it to keep accurate time. Second it is very comfortable, I forget I have it on most of the time. Third, it is cheap! As in very inexpensive, while still being a quality wristwatch. Fourth, it is pretty durable (or at least it seems to be) without too much  added bulk. So to sum it up, I am very satisfied with the watch. Would I recommend it to someone i know? yes Note: I haven't read the manual, and hate reading manuals in general. I am sure there are tons of features this watch has, but am too lazy to figure them out. I just need a watch that keeps time, shows me the day, time, and that's it. This is by far (for the money) the best watch purchase i have ever made."

I am sure they are all good value for the money.  I just wanted him to have a G-shock !! I've just become interested in these square G-shocks a few weeks ago. Kind of a nostalgia type thing. I saw these around when I was in my late teens and '20's, but never owned one until now.  I just spent some major $$ here on Amazon for a GW-5000-1JF and another with the negative display model GW-5510-1BJF. MY POINT BEING ::: You don't have to blow your income tax refund like I just did and get the solar/atomic bells & whistles ones.. This  $46.00 G-shock is a great ,quality, nice looking watch!!

I would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to buy a long lasting dependable watch. And for those people reading/writing 2 and 3 star because one of the buttons in ""stuck"", it is not stuck.

The beauty of this watch is that it is as utilitarian as a hammer and just as indestructible.  I bought one for myself and another for my father as a gift.  Mine has been covered in paint, gone diving in salt water, and gone skiing and camping in tough conditions.  It is routinely used while I run and ends up dripping in sweat.  Over nearly 1.5 years of this activity level and there is not even a mark on the plastic band.  My dad is finding out the same thing after destroying his past two watches due to inadvertent impacts or water intrusion.  I have owned a couple of Timex Ironman models and this watch is much more robustly constructed.  Very simple and easy to read interface, controls are intuitive.  You can throw the instructions away.  The Amazon price is great, as well, compared to other websites or retail outlets near me (Chicagoland area). This watch is not cool, it is not fancy, and it has zero ""bling"".  I don't know if that makes me like it even more.  I am a watch collector, and have a number of very nice swiss timepieces in my collection.  However, the Casio ends up being on my wrist more than any of my other watches, even for work functions or places where I am typically dressed up.  I think the Casio is so anti-fashion that it actually makes a fashion statement."

Those watches feature three gratuitous circular ""moon"" displays that do nothing but tick off seconds with a supposedly cool graphic display. This is just a waste of space designed to, well...to waste space. The DW5600E, on the other hand, gives you only the information you need, in a clean, uncluttered display. I had one for years, but it leaked after I had the battery replaced. The watch store gave me a pricier G-Shock Illuminator for free, but I sold it on eBay to buy this model. The only negative is that the four setting buttons are relatively small and slightly inset relative to those on the big G-Shocks.  As a result, they are a bit harder to use. The only display NOT on this watch that is included in the big G-Shocks is a world clock. But who needs it?  It is simple enough to change the time zone when you fly somewhere. Do you really need to know the current time in NYC -- or in Kabul, for that matter?"

MAYBE.","This is my third Casio watch in this product/price range and they have been durable and accurate -- though the backlight feature weakens and dies over time, a fact they previously failed to mention but now admit in the product info.  My concern, also sparked by the new product info (more a disclaimer, really) is the water-resistance feature.  I understand this is not a dive watch, and I have no intention of taking it down to 200 meters -- but my previous Casios I have showered, and bathed in; more to the point, I swim about 3-5 miles a week and have done so wearing those watches to no detectable ill effect. T his model, despite being ""resistant"" to 200m, the company goes overboard in counselling me not to shower or bathe wearing the watch, let alone (heaven forfend) swim in it...I can't tell whether this is an actual  warning that I've wasted my money this time around because the watch will die the first shower I take, or just a massive effort at butt-covering, Just In Case.  If the latter, I don't care. if the former, obviously, I do.  Will revisit this post with further information down the line. O yes -- I found extremely annoying the fact that you cannot change out the bracelet on this watch.  I hatehatehate those resin bands, and have always in the past pulled them off and put on my stainless band in their place.  Apparently there is no way to do this with this watch (Thanks a bunch, Casio) so I'm stuck with the band that is uncomfortable and makes my wrist sweat.  That alone will prevent me from ever buying a Casio again.  YMMV."

Maybe too classic.","The bottom line is that I sent the watch back because one of the buttons was pushed in permanently (i.e. flush with the case) and therefore was nearly impossible to push.  While I did not take this review down a notch to four stars for that reason (since I assume I could have gotten one with 4 good buttons) I did take it down to four stars because the buttons, even when at their normal position, are not easy to push. The watch had everything I wanted and I was really psyched about the small current time display in timer mode.  But in the end, I asked for a refund rather than a replacement due to the small buttons.  Compared to the Timex Ironman I eventually settled on, the classic Casio was too classic.  Those buttons need an upgrade.  (I will admit I have virtually no fingernails, so that may be part of the problem.  However, the Timex buttons could be pressed even if I had no fingers.  They're, like, real buttons.) By the way, for the really cheap Casio and Timex alike, the resin band is about as basic as can be.  It looks really cheap and, well, these watches are really cheap, so it should not come as a surprise.  We'll see how it holds up to daily use and some swimming this summer."

She needed a good rugged watch to use in the field, so I gave her this one. That was about thirty years ago. It still works to this day. I was browsing watches at Amazon the other day and came across it again. The type of work I do is pretty rough on watches and I knew this watch was tough so I ordered it. I've ordered many cheap throw-away watches and they are exactly that. It's a tough watch and still looks good for the times. Besides, I didn't want to damage my Vintage Casio AMW-320C dive watch.

As others have mentioned the top left ""adjust"" button is recessed into the watch case.  This is done on purpose because this is the button you push on the main time screen to set the time.  The problem is that this is also used as the reset button for the stopwatch, and the button to set the time for the timer.  It is near impossible to push when wearing the watch, and extremely difficult to push when the watch is off using just fingers.  With something pointy like a pen, it's no problem, but you shouldn't need a tool to reset the stopwatch.  I understand making the set time button hard to push so as not to accidentally change the time setting, but either don't use that same button as the reset button for the other features, or use a different method to access the set time function.  Overall kind of disappointed since I like Casio watches a lot in general and really like the overall aesthetic of this watch.  The functionality limitations to easily resetting the stopwatch and timer are sort of a deal breaker."

It's got a few minor scratches on the face, but no other visible damage. The buttons are inset so you'll never accidentally hit them. The alarm is a little quiet so don't rely on it to wake you up unless you're a very light sleeper. It also has a stopwatch, timer, and backlight feature. Plus you can easily change the time to 24hr time (aka military). Only 4 stars because it did get a little moisture in there which would only show inside the face when I was hot and the weather was cold (ie. hiking through the mountains in 10° weather) which partially obscured my view, I expected the battery to last a little longer, and the alarm was silent."

I had one of the 5600c's back in the 80's when they were still relatively new. I wore that one for seven years on the original battery. I had to change the band a couple of times but that was the only maintenance required. I was working construction at the time and I never gave it a second thought. I ran a chipping hammer, dug holes, sawed wood, Pounded  nails. After work I swam in the ocean, sat in a sauna and water skied, you name it, and the watch never skipped a beat. My friends got sick of me bragging that the watch was virtually indestructible. The only negative thing that I can say is that the watch was a little heavier than other watches I've worn since then. The new version (almost identical to the first one I had) now has a resin case that is much lighter than the old version. I couldn't be happier with the new one. If it lasts half as long as the old one and withstands half as much abuse, It is worth the purchase price. Thanks Casio and keep making them."

Having owned numerous extra rugged G-Shock watches (which this is not), I understood I was getting a basic watch with basic features. Once the watch arrived, I saw that the display was difficult to see and that the illumination button is recessed to the point that I find it difficult to press without fumbling around trying to find the button. The band is not very hardy. After a few days I noticed a little stretching. I have had bands like this one before so I knew I might as well replace it with a nylon beaded band with Velcro. See the pics in this review. With or without this band, most wearers will know this is a basic shell of the Casio G-Shock line. 3 stars because I like the brand. A new Casio band is half the price of the new watch. Not worth it for me."

I decided to give it a try since for $40 you really can't loose much, you'll always find someone who will buy it form you. Very glad I did this watch looks great, has only functions you really need,  it is not fancy or blingy, it just has a very utilitarian look, all of the information is nicely depicted, such as the box with the date. I have heard the battery lasting for many years, this is another advantage of this watch. With It's low profile it can go with just about anything, I prefer this to the 6900.

I prefer small watches and while the 5600e is larger than a typical mechanical field watch, its light weight wears very well. The larger Gshocks don't appeal to me.

I only ask that he give it 30 days to get used to it, before he passes judgment. The watch has all the typical Casio features, styling, rugged while not being/looking bulky, and a great first ""real"" watch for tweens. I gave it four stars, rather than five, simply because the bezel doesn't sit a bit higher, to better protect the crystal from scratches and abrasions. I foresee it getting scratches because of this. We ordered the Casio Men's DW290-1V ""Classic"" Sport Watch for our 11 year old as well. It's a great watch as well! It has more of the G-Shock look to it, which our 11 year old appreciates."

I spent a week reviewing it and I was looking forward to get it after going though timex watches every 2 years. I thought the casio shock design would help and I liked the features of the watch such as the clock display in the stopwatch and countdown timer modes as well has the nice clean square face. Its a great protected watch without being bulky and is really comfortable on the wrist. However here is the reason I returned this item. Every time you transition the watch mode it beeps. I did not like this. After some research the only way to resolve this was by disabling the watch alarm by taking apart the watch. After this some other slight annoyances made me realize that this was not something I wanted to keep on me and rely on for the next 2+ years. The adjust button is hard to press, I'm sure with time I would have learned to live with. The second thing was the adjustment of numbers only went up. The timex watches I have always had had an up and down adjust setting, its just a nicety that makes adjustments quick and painless. But like a said those were minor inconveniences which I think I could have learned to live with, but ultimately the beeping between modes without an option to turn off was the reason I returned this item."

I love a watch you can wear nearly anywhere without worrying about it getting beat up and still looking great with a quick rinse.  This is by far my favorite G-Shock I've ever owned and a no brainer for the price.  It's the best of G-Shock without all the extras that seem to get in the way (satellite reset, DST, etc).  Additionally, it is much lighter and the lower profile, compared to my other models, allows me to wear it under long sleeves, even dress shirts.  Also, if you have smaller wrists, this one will feel more natural and comfortable. Most people who don't know G-Shock won't get it.  They think it looks like its cousin ($15 black plastic basic Casio).  For me that was one of the things that drew me too it.  It is a no fuss, get it done watch, but still looks good with a dress shirt and tie or steel toe boots, especially when the guy next to you dropped a couple grand on his vanity watch.  This watch says ""I'm confident with who I am and don't need an overpriced watch to make me feel better about myself."""

There are stopwatch, timer, hourly chime, alarm clock .... but the settings button (top left), which resets the timer and stopwatch, and customizable clock completely recessed into the body so that it can not press any finger or fingernail, and therefore these functions are absolutely useless, until you find something sharp than you can push it.

Its super durable, has every basic feature I need and is perfectly sized. Its not too big and its not too small. The LCD is crystal clear and sharp! This watch does have Casio's EL feature so the display will light up evenly making it very easy to read in the dark. It also has a mineral glass crystal which is a big step up from a plastic screen cover. When you buy a G-Shock watch your buying something that's way more durable then a standard watch, your buying something that can be used and abused without worrying too much. The price that Casio sells these at makes this particular G-Shock something of ""beater"" or everyday watch. I am going to try and keep this watch clean, but I'm also not going to worry about it getting bumped or dropped. This watch is timeless in its design. It will continue to look good even twenty years from now. Its just so simplistic yet good looking."

The adjust button was designed smaller to avoid being pressed by mistake. The concept is fine if all it is used for is to change time but the adjust button also is used to reset the stop watch. This is one of the key complications I use on my watches for workouts. It's very frustrating to spend time trying to dig your finger in there to reset the stopwatch. You would have to spend another 20 bucks or so for a replacement button to mod it to sit out like the other buttons. I may consider this but that just adds to the price. I do appreciate that this is one of the only square watches from gshock that allows you to set the timer in second increments which is great for timing down rest periods inbetween workout sets. Keep the adjust button issue in mind when buying. If you have smaller fingers or nails it might not be such a big pain. Looks very nice though."

Nothing fancy but covers the bases. Accurate digital time, light to read in the dark, alarm, stop watch, dual time to keep track of 2 different time zones, and waterproof.  Use your smartphone if you want to know the weather, temperature, barometer, altitude.  The same if you need a compass.  It's boring but I have been using this same watch for over 20 years.  Whenever the strap breaks, 5 years or so, I order a new one.  Sometimes I think of getting a fancier watch that looks dressier and has more features and then I ask myself why.  I can easily afford any watch Amazon offers regardless of price.  For the fourth time I bought this one.  By the way, the battery can last 10 years or so.  When the strap breaks you can buy another one for $13 on Amazon.  As inexpensive as they are, I just splurge for new one.  It's up to you."

This can be a problem, however, when you just want something cheap and reliable to bang up on a hike or helping your friend move. As one who always has to be wearing a watch I finally got tired of the paranoia of putting a ding in the side of my Tag Heuers or Omegas and figured I'd spend a few bucks on a watch I wouldn't mind utterly destroying. After a good amount of research I settled on the quintessential G-Shock Classic and couldn't be happier. Not being one to particularly like the feel of resin watch bands, I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable this watch was right out of the box. Usability wise, all the features are handy and easy to access and the construction quality of the case and band are surprisingly good. No rough edges or anything to cause discomfort have been discovered as of yet. I also tend to have somewhat sensitive skin when wearing synthetic bands and haven't suffered any irritation so far. My only 2 minor gripes are the fact that the beep sound when cycling through features cannot be turned off and there is no way to keep the back-light on while adjusting functions. Other than that, I'd say this watch is the watch the buy if you're looking for a durable, utilitarian digital watch at an affordable price."

You can easily glance at it and quickly identify the time, date and day of week without trying too hard to read it.  I found that 90 percent of the functions on other gshocks I would almost never use.  For the price point, it would be hard to find a watch that is as durable and as good looking as this version.

The Day/Date display and backlight are all great. My issue is that the upper left ""adjust"" button is impossible to reliably push, it's so far buried into the watch body I assumed it was defective until I saw everyone else's comments on it. I have to hit it with my fingernail at just the right angle or use a pen to click it. Now, you can make the argument that's not a big deal, because you're not going to be frequently setting the time, which is fair. However, if you ever actually intend to use the timer, alarm, or stopwatch function then you're stuck, because the adjust button is integral to all of these functions. It's a little crazy to me that I need to have a pen to reset the stopwatch? How is that a thing? I decided to keep the watch because it was relatively cheap and I like the look enough to outweigh the fact that essentially all functions other than time keeping are useless due to a poor design."

The DW-5600E looks a little like the DW-240 but is more bulky because of the extra protection if offers. The buttons are a little harder to press because they are somewhat recessed. Talking about buttons, while Adjust and Mode on the left have the same location, Start-Stop and Light on the right are switched. The screens are very similar but the DW-5600E offers indigo backlighting while the DW-240 only had a little useless light on the side. Oddly the DW-5600E does not offer a dual time feature or a Rem(ember) function. Instead it offers the possibility to have the light turn on when the alarm is ringing. Finally the DW-5600E is built in China and not in Japan as the DW-240 was. Only time will tell if this has any impact on the robustness."

As this was my everyday watch, I was always banging it up in the shop, doing things around the house, etc; I finely caught it on something in the truck & made the band pin hole even bigger so it would not hold at all. The Watch itself is still going strong, keeping great time, but time to get a new one. On this new version, they have attached the band with what looks like screws, so will have to see how it holds up over the next twenty years. (I am an Octogenarian so it will outlast me) I also have a higher priced SS solar powered G-Shock for dress up, which is still going strong. Very happy with these two Casio watches."

It has held up to clunks, wacks, temperature fluctuations, swimming, hiking, everyday work, animal bites, and on an on.  I don't know how, but there is not a scratch on this watch...it ""almost"" looks like the day I got it.  The only thing I have noticed is some very slight speckling/color change on the bottom of the band (this might have been from the chlorine-my bad).  The only other issues I have are these: the buttons are not the easiest to push-takes some practice.  And finally, I was a bit disappointed to see ""Made in China"" on the back of the watch...it's not like I was expecting to see ""Made in the USA"", but was maybe hoping for a ""Made in Japan.""  One final note, I was worried about the size of the watch, as I have smaller size wrists-no problem with that.  Looks really good."

After wearing it every day for about 15 years the rubber outside case had disintigrated and I was wearing the watch with the bare metal inner case showing.  I replaced it with another one and had it for about 7 years when it was ruined in a house fire.  All of the plastic/rubber got melted away, but the watch in it's metal inner case was still running for a month or so after the fire.  It eventually died but who expects a watch to survive a fire?

For 7-8 years I had an earlier model G-Shock that Casio no longer makes (forget the exact model number, similar to DW-003), and it was retired and given to a relative. It still worked like a champ, and I only had to change the battery once. It was subjected to pretty rough use, including flow testing water systems. But I had always liked the simple, clean looks of the 5600 series -- so I snagged one of these DW-5600E-1V's from Amazon back in Jan. 2009. We are now into 2013 and the watch has been doing great. At this point it has been taken on hikes, worn in the river, carried in triple-digit and freezing temperatures, and generally been beat up doing just about anything and everything. Other than some wear and small nicks on the band and case, and a microscopic scratch on the bezel, it works like the day I unpacked it. (Wish I could have said the same of my Seiko SKX173 diver! One drop to the floor and that thing was history.) Bottom line... the G-Shocks just work, period!"

As an Explosive Ordnance Disposal Diver, I grew tired of the five-pound Seiko dive watch issued by my diver locker.  It looked cool, but lost two minutes a day.  Because of the reliability of Casio dive watches, most Navy dive lockers purchased and issued Casios only a few years later.  When batteries died after a few years or the watch bands started cracking or broke, you were permitted to exchange for a new one.  After 26 years of Navy diving, I ended up with a few 6900 models which are bigger and bulkier than the DW5600.  When they all required new batteries and bands, I decided to go back to the first Casio I found truly functional without taking up my entire wrist.  The DW5600 provides all the features 95% of purchasers will require.  I've dove this watch on mixed gas to 200 feet and subjected it to plenty of mud and sand while diving on mines without issue.  No need to spend double for the ""mudman"" model.  This is the best watch for the money period!"

I bought what looks like the indentical model about 11 years ago and amazingly, it was the same price...about $30.00.  Although I had to change the wrist band occasionally, they were easily available at mall watch stores.  The amazing thing about this watch was that I used it for 10 years without ever changing the battery.  The downside I guess, is that when I did go to get a battery replacement, the watch had died...a new replacement battery didn't get it to work.  Well, it certainly didn't owe me anything after 10 years of keeping accurate time and never showing a scratch on the face despite heavy use during all kinds of work and play.  Its ugly for sure, but considering I've owned a lot more fancy and expensive watches, this one is the most reliable and dependable...it never let me down and its alarm always worked when I needed it.  I never did use the other features but they always functioned.  For the price and reliability and if you like 'ugly', its a good bargain.

I could not be more pleased with the actual watch itself. As to be expected though, the battery is getting towards the end of its life and needs replacing. No surprise there. However, I have contacted Casio three times now (only twice receiving a response in reply) with regards to the cost of a battery replacement. Both times the representatives informed me that Casio does not give estimates for repairs without first examining the watch in person. I explained clearly each time that what I desired was a quote for a simple battery replacement, a base cost for the procedure with the understanding that the price was an approximation of what the service would cost (obviously this would not be legally binding in any way) and could scale up from there. Essentially, I wanted them to ballpark it for me. Still I was given a long winded song and dance about Casio's policies and procedures, but wouldn't you know it - no price quote. That was when I was lucky enough to get a response at all. This did come as a surprise since I expected more in the way of quality customer service from Casio. I assume all the sheepishness regarding a quote on a battery replacement is because the servicing is likely to run higher than the cost of the watch itself. Of course, I have no way of knowing this for certain because I cannot get a straight-forward answer out of Casio to save my life! This secretive behavior regarding the pricing of a simple battery replacement is as frustrating as it is bizarre. This experience has really turned me off on Casio. I guess that I expected more in the way of honest well intentioned help and transparency from Casio. But I won't have to guess again, because now I know! 1 Star"

No moving parts means better shock resistance and waterproofing than any moving-parts (ie analogue, and particularly mechanical or automatic) watch can deliver. 2. Casio has perfected ruggedness in watches over the last 30 years - they are better than anyone at this game by now. 3. Simplicity of design and use means the timepiece is functional under the most stressful situations. The format of this excellent watch harkens back - way back - to the Casio Mariner, a watch that accompanied me to five oceans and six continents over more than two decades, and only gave up after I had beaten it mercilessly in surf, snow, desert sands and the occasional urban adventure. At under $40 shipped, this is the best value in a timepiece I'll ever get, and the same goes for you. The folks who retail radioactive luminescence on analogue dials want you to think that Navy SEALs use their watches, and maybe that's true - when they're on leave and trying to pick up recently released female felons at sleazy roadhouses. On the job they do what Marine infantrymen do - they strap on a G-shock and twist its face downward to minimise glare and movement when checking the time."

This Casio was certainly the best choice, I've no doubt on quality and functionality, my only concern was the size because I've a small wrist but I solved it by trying one on at the local store.  The design now it looks more like a classic instead of a old model, everyone will notice a classic G Shock because of the brand/model combination, it's even more captivating than newer G Shock models.

Since that time, it was been my ""go to"" watch and has been on my wrist almost constantly.  From every ocean vacation to every backpacking adventure, it has never failed me.  In the last eight years, I have replaced the band once (to be expected) and that is it!  It is practically military grade in its build quality and has handled everything I have thrown at it with no issues.  I am, FINALLY AFTER EIGHT YEARS, going to replace the battery because the backlight is beginning to dim when depressed.  It seems to GAIN about 30 seconds every six months but that is not a problem since I synchronize it every DST time change.  I cannot reccommend this watch enough.

It's a modern version of the watch I owned in the early 90's with some welcoming positive changes. First of all, the illuminating light makes it very easy to see when dark. Secondly, the hourly chime is not nearly as annoying as the only one.  Instead of a loud ""Beep Beep"", it's 2 faint beeps that are the perfect volume. This one also comes with a 'light flashing' option when the alarm is going off.  Not sure what the advantage of this would be unless you were hard of hearing and happened to be looking @ the watch, but there's no drawbacks to the option. All in all, it's a very basic watch with 1 alarm, a timer, a stopwatch, an hourly chime and the time, date and day on the main screen. My Dad stole my old G-Shock from the early 90s and still uses it today, so if this one is even close in durability and reliability, then it will be around a long time."

The button used to adjust the time, alarms, timer, and stopwatch, is extremely recessed into the case, with a big piece of the case material hanging over it. This makes it incredibly difficult to press the button. Some might not find it so tough, but my fingers strength isn't the best, and my fingertips are sensitive to pressure. You have to press the button VERY hard, even with a fingernail. Without a fingernail? Next to impossible. I don't want to have to use a pen or a key to use the button. I feel as if I should be able to adjust the watch using my hands, like most other watches. The presence of this hard-to-press button makes this watch a product that is not for me. As for the other functions, they all seem to work pretty well. I like the addition of the current time to the stopwatch and timer modes. The face is bright and easy to read. The other three buttons are fairly easy to press. If you can get around the adjust button issue, this seems like a good, solid watch for the price."

This one popped out because of the simplicity of the face as well as the stopwatch and countdown timer. an added bonus was that it keeps the month/day up to the year 2100 when you put in the current year, that's a nice feature. Also, the watch is very durable: I do work with wrenches around pipes and cement and have banged it against many things and it is none the worse for the wear. the outer protection protects the face, and it is shock resistant, so I don't even hesitate putting it in places I wouldn't even think about putting any of my other watches.

Time and date are easy to read and the green light mode is great. Screw down back so changing battery is easy. The resin housing and band on this watch along with other g shocks is amazing.  I work construction and this watch gets dirty a lot and all you gotta do is rinse it off with water and it looks like new.  Its nice not having a crown that sticks out because my other more expensive watches will get caught on my jean pocket while pulling my hand out and the crown will pull out causing to change time, dont have to worry about that happening with this, and its nice that its 200m water resistant.

First, the style is discrete, it's not flashy, bulky or have unnecessary parts thrown on it. It serves to tell you the time which it does really well. One feature I love is that when in other modes it will show you the time in the corner of the display. It has all the mode functions you could need to tell time and it has a simple layout for executing actions. I needed a watch, nothing grand or overly complex, something that had a high build quality and was simple to use. That was exactly what I found in this watch.

It stays secure on my wrist without strapping it tightly, in contrast to my other watches that tend to slide over to an awkward angle unless I tighten their straps so much that the watch parts uncomfortably impress my skin. Not only is the watch comfortable, but its display is also very easy to read with all the important data stated on the ""home"" screen. The light is easy to use, the buttons remain protected, and you know that the watch as a whole will be able to take a beating for years to come."

About three years ago the watch band needed replacment and then three months ago the battery finally went.  When replacing the battery they didn't have the correct tool to remove the back and cracked part of the front the case (noticed this after leaving).  When replacing the battery they said it wasn't as good as the original one and would only last few years at best.  So it seemed like a good time to replace the watch.  It would probably cost more to replace the battery again that what I originally paid for the watch. With all the different models and features that G-Shock has evoled into at first it was a hard decision for what model to get.  In the end--I just needed a rugged watch with good time accuracy and basic functions.  Feels comfortable to wear--forgot how nice the original watch band is versus the replacement I had to get with the first G-Shock.  Expect to get the same life out of this one as the first one."

I'm a semi retired guide and this has literally been round the world and back.  It has all the features I really need and none of the crap I don't (I do have a Sunto that I don't wear and a Seiko that I do).  I liked the DW5600e so much that the protective rubber casing eventually cracked and wore off.  I guess I got my moneys worth. Saturday I caught the replacement velcro band on a jib block while racing the Hobie Cat.  Whoops - guess the fish in Cacasde Reservior won't be late for dinner.  Purchased the replacement today for less than what I think I payed for the origional.  Thats value. If want something that works and will last a long time buy this watch.

The only problem I had with a less expensive Casio was the watch was great, but the band was junk.  And to replace the band cost more that to replace the watch.  This watch has a much better band and I expect to have a better chance of wearing it many years longer.  This watch is very well built and I expect to get several years of excellent service.  I use the stop watch functions a lot to time my rest intervals while weight training.  The only negative is the print of the watch face is almost too small to read.  Good thing the positions can be easily memorized.  Also, the ""adjust"" button is very hard to use, but the other three buttons work much better.  Time will tell but Casio is a good bet."

I previously used the DBC-150 and DBC-310 calculator watches, both of which included a  countdown timer feature.

Over the years I found that I valued the countdown timer much more than the calculator so, after months of research and thought, I chose the DW5600E-1V Sport Watch specifically because it had a countdown timer.

Rubber outer casing and strap finally gave out, then lense cracked but the electronics to my original model in it's inner metal casing still works. The new model has the same functions as the old, but they switched some of the controls around and improved the light. The strap is now integrated into one piece with the front outer casing so it can't be replaced if the strap breaks.The rear of the casing was changed and seems to make replacing the battery easier. Had to buy this if it's anything like the original, so far no problems and I'm pleased with my purchase."

So, obviously his work as an Aborist and outdoor enthusiast was too much for it. I wanted something reasonably priced but well built. He wanted something simple, with the time, date and an alarm. This watch was all of that. With the simple function control he was able to set it up in minutes. Other reviewers mention the style of the watch being unattractive, but Dad doesn't care. It fits him better than the sleek new-age looking ones. He likes it a lot! I can't speak to the longevity yet, but I will update this review if we have any issues with it's function. Other buyers said their Casio is still ticking along after 15+ years of wear and damage. So i have high hopes."

For one, it has only one alarm which is good for me. It also comes with a countdown timer and a stopwatch. What I liked was that after adjusting the alarm, timer, or stopwatch, it takes you back to the time after clicking Mode, which eliminates useless and time consuming navigation through the modes. I also liked than unlike my previous Casio, the light stays on for 2 seconds turning it off; no need to hold it. One thing I found annoying is how hard the buttons are compared to my other Casio, but I guess it's necessary to make this watch so durable. As for durability, I've performed lots of tests since receiving it. I've frozen it, poured boiling water on it, and I've hit it against various surfaces throughout my day. The 'G-SHOCK' and 'Protection' letters haven't faded or anything. Overall, its a durable, easy to use, feature packed watch, and I'd recommend it to anyone. You won't get another great watch like this for the price."

This watch exceeded my expectations. I have owned several higher end watches from Luminox to Suunto. I prefer this watch over the $400 watches I have owned. When the band broke on my Suunto Core, I priced them on Amazon for $40. For the same price I thought I would give this watch a try. The size is perfect. Not too big, not too small. If you are looking for a watch that has an altimeter, barometer, thermometer, and warns you when a storm is approaching, buy the Suunto Core. Just plan on shelling out $40 every 12 months when the strap breaks. If you want a no nonsense, rugged watch that only tells time and has basic functions, buy this watch. You will not regret it!"

Aside from that I'm not terribly pleased with this model.  I had a Casio a number of years ago and it served its purpose.  In general Casios have black digits on a grey background.  Not terribly easy to read in marginal light.  Actually not easy to see at all. If you aren't looking at the face dead-on, reading the time, etc. is at best difficult.This model's light is okay but it was so well protected with projections that one has to find the light button in the dark with a finger nail and is so bright when the light is turned on that for a few moments the digits are hard to read.  Whereas the Casio that I had many years ago the light button was easy to find and when the button was released, the light would immediately turned off; this particular model the light stays on for a few seconds before turning off. If you're of a tactical nature and you want instant 'off' look somewhere else. OK. Time for a re-evaluation.No matter what the instructions may say the day of the week is NOT tied automatically to the date. It SHOULD be but it isn't. To change the day of the week is a song and a dance, which I don't mind too much, but when part of the dance is a 'number' of no particular value that appears in the 'day' space it's a guess, at least to me, how far to advance this meaningless number to the day of the week. The bright idea of black alpha-numeric on a grey background is NOT bright. I'm repeating myself, I know, but this really galls me! Because I'm a prettry OK guy I'm giving this watch two stars. If I was a jerk, but honest I'd give it a single star and grind my teeth. Look elsewhere."

I have dropped it countless times, banged it (by accident) against walls and tables god knows how many times. Lived in really humid environments for long periods without getting any moisture inside the watch. I also swim regularly during the summer time with my watch on. It has yet broken down, nor has it required a new battery or strap yet. This thing is indestructable!"

Clements","16 Jan 2013","4.0","Excellent watch, one small issue.....","This is my fourth G Shock. Got it for a great price on amazon, $40 for a time tested, durable watch. My only issue is the top left button being too small. If this button was strictly for setting time and date, this wouldn't be an issue. Those are occasional use....The problem is that it's the reset for the stopwatch/timer also. Frequent stopwatch/timer users, may get a little annoyed using their nails or fumbling to reset. One alarm, timer, stopwatch, date, day, and time viewable in the main screen. Wish this came with the auto EL feature, but oh well.... Other than that its a perfect watch. Everything said about the durability is true. There are no 'cheap G Shocks', meaning they're all bombproof. Anything you can to to damage this watch will def hurt the user, if wearing."

I removed the rubber piece that covers the face, off the watch and placed a cut out piece of Zagg invisible shield protector on the watch's plastic face, placed the rubber thing back on and viola! extra scratch protection. I have bathed, swam in pools, oceans and washed my hands hundreds of times with this watch and it held up. The area underneath where the bands connect to the body gets pretty funky so I wash that under the faucet with some soap and my wife's toothbrush and it's still doing great. It lose about 1-3 minutes a month I guess, whooptedoo. Battery still going strong over a year. I usually have bad luck with watches, but thus far all is well. P.S.

I particularly like the way you can see the time and countdown timer at the same time. Quips: 1) Adjust button is too recessed and hard to push. 2) Wish they made at least one g-shock that was more slim. I modified mine to address these imperfections. Also, I compare this model to other Casio models on my blog: http://wp.me/phJn8-5k And yes, I'm sentimental about the watch as I've owned g-shocks since the 80s. I can't believe with all the models Casio makes in both G-shock and other lines, that they can't make a digital watch with a countdown timer, that fits under cuffs of shirt sleeves! C'est la vie..."

The best value for money G-Shock!","This is definitely the best G-Shock money can buy in terms of value. It's durable, reliable, easy to use, has the classic looks and fun to wear! My only complaint is that the display digits are not contrasty enough, makes you feel like the battery is low, however, taking into consideration the price of the watch, this is fully understandable. The higher-end G-Shocks and the ones made in Japan have better contrasty displays. Otherwise, a fantastic all-rounder!"

It's super light and durable and doesn't feel like your even wearing it.

However, 2 problems have raised their ugly heads; buckle and tides. The buckle on the watchband insists on rubbing, and cutting it's way into my wrist. I wear a small bandaid as a buffer zone, but how many years must I invest in bandaids? The tides are a neat feature for fishermen, and I qualify. However, even with my college education, I've been unable to adjust the tides feature. It's flashing.....but....for where....and what time?????

Since the watch is large, it can weigh on the wrist.  When doing vigorous outdoor work such as gardening or swimming, I would prefer having more adjustment points.

I am used to my Casio W800 so when I got the DW 5600 I thought that numerals are too somewhat faded and small. The light button does not work when in alarm setting mode.

When adjusting the countdown timer, the numbers only move one way, and it doesn't have multiple time zones.  The battery life may not be all that long (but replacements are cheap, assuming you can get into the watch and put it back together). The price is easily 1/2 or 1/3 of a more elaborate G-Shock, and when you consider how fast any of them basically stops working (5-7 years in my experience), you could almost save money getting this one and just tossing it when the battery fails, then buying another."

My only complaint with this watch is in regards to the backlight, and when it refuses to work. When setting the alarm, the backlight will not come on, even though that button performs no other function in this mode. This means that you cannot set the alarm in the dark, which is very annoying if you are camping or in a shared room and don't want to turn on the lights just to set your alarm. The backlight will also not work when setting the event timer, but instead toggles the ""automatic"" mode which causes the timer to restart automatically when it reaches zero. Overall, its a great watch, but this one design flaw means I probably wouldn't purchase another one."

I've done even worse, and this watch just (to coin a phrase) takes a licking and keeps on ticking. The only drawback is that it is sort-of ugly.

Pros: -simple to use. - one alarm, one button for glow, one for tone on off - lighter, and stronger than most other watches for the price point. -color is simple and appealing to the eye. -affordable Cons: it's non solar(cost 50 bucks more)"

There are 4 buttons on the watch to set time, alarm, etc.  The ""A"" button is seriously recessed, making it difficult to push.  It is used to access the setting modes so not a problem as not done very often.  If you want to use it as a stop watch, the A button also has a function there, which would make it inconvenient to do splits and to reset the stop watch function.  Basically very difficult to use that button, which in general is a good thing."

I don't know what more you could ask form a watch. The band on some of the variants of this model is a little softer, and the display on the more expensive models is slightly clearer from all angles. This model is also the perfect introduction to the G-shock line if you are used to smaller watches.

Others who dont give this a strong review clearly arent buying the watch for what it is: totally awesome.  If you cant read the display G shock doesnt care, blind people arent its demographic.  The buttons are small and minimalist in design, but huge in terms of staying out of the way of your cufflink when your shifting from 5th to 6th on Need For Speed on your Playstation3.

I chose this particular model for its retro appearance. My dad told me how he had this exact watch in the 80's and that was a big selling point for me. The backlight is nice and bright and it's simple to figure out every function. I haven't even opened the instruction manual yet. On a side note, some reviews on other sites said the back casing is made of resin. This is false (as far as this particular model is concerned) because the casing is made of stainless steel which has a satin finish instead of the polished screwbacks I've seen on the originals from the 80's (which is the only con about this model). Overall I am very pleased with my new favorite watch and look forward to wearing it every day."

The face now has a tiny scratch, but I'm sure it's a result of my knocking it against practically everything, including numerous warehouse racks, retail shelves and a forklift. There are not enough good things that I can say about this watch. It fits well. I beat the heck out of it on a daily basis and it's still working. It'll probably outlast me.

Mielke","30 Apr 2017","3.0","Countdown timer alarm can be flakey","I depend a lot on the countdown timer, and that has gone flakey on me. It counts down, but the alarm goes off only about half the time. At first I thought that I just wasn't hearing the alarm, but I've run tests where I'd just stare at the watch when during the countdown, and sure enough it sometimes just remains silent. This is a problem -- I count on the timer to alert me when it's time to flip the steak on the BBQ, shut off a running hose, etc. I've bought three of these watches in the past 8 years. The most recent one's alarm started going flakey after only 6 months. The one before went flakey after 3 years. In neither case did the battery seem to be the issue. I give it 3 stars only because I like the watch in other ways, and perhaps I've been unlucky and gotten lemons the past two times."

Extremely functional with almost no bells and whistles (just the way I like it). Being in the military, I was looking for something simple and tough that wouldn't draw a lot of attention...this is it. I could not be happier...in fact I am ecstatic. This is the watch I should have bought 5 years ago instead of buying the cheap Ironman watches which always fall apart after two years of use.

If the waterproof seal is not reinstalled perfectly during a battery change, the watch will leak and fail. Other than that, this watch should last many years under harsh conditions."

The buttons are a little challenging to operate if you're not coordinated with your fingernails but I generally keep my alarm setting fixed for fairly long periods of time. I swim regularly without problems. I did recently purchase another Casio that was a bit sleeker and nicer looking. It has minute and hour hands- I was very disappointed because it was very hard to set the time. That watch has the number 3321 in a box on the back followed by AW-49H."

It took me about 2 minutes to set the watch onto the perfect time and date! Not to big like other G-shocks and has everything you need in a watch! Tells great time in 12 or 24hr time also shows the day and date. Has an Alarm a stopwatch and a countdown timer. What else do you need? This watch looks great and is not heavy but yet it feels like you could drop it off a sky scraper and it would survive. Can't say enough good things about it. If your thinking about buying a G-shock or a sports watch in general save your money and buy one of these its unbelievable value for money and you  would be crazy not to choose it!"

Wonderful Gift!","I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine in the Marine Corps, since he lost his during boot camp. He loved it, and I loved it. Not because of the great deal I got (2 day shipping here, compared to 2 weeks with another vendor) but because I also worked at a watch and jewelry repair shop. I knew exactly how to program it without looking in the instruction manual, and it was SO easy. You can set it for normal time, as well as military time. It also has timers and a stop watch. All of the basics you could ever want. It seems like a sturdy watch, and comes with a warranty, so you also get some peace of mind. Overall, great buy. Definitely would buy another one for him if he lost this one too. :-P"

It won't break the bank to buy one, and yet it keeps time as accurately as any watch costing 100x as much. Update, June 2013-- Minor note, the face illumination used to activate when the alarm went off but stopped doing so after about six months of use.  I'm not sure if this is a normal function of the watch to prevent excessive battery drain, but it's not a big deal for me.  It's still working on the original battery. The band has shown some signs of wear, but other than that, it's still good to go.  I don't shower with the watch on, as I've heard that warm water has a ""drying"" effect on watch bands made of this material. As I said earlier, a great watch for the money."

I've worn  these watches to over 100 feet diving, banged and pounded them while doing all manner of rough chores, and had them last for a shocking number of years between battery changes, despite the abuse. Unfortunately, since the last model Casio G-Shock I had, Casio apparently changed the control buttons so that, in this model watch, you cannot work the light while you are setting the alarm, timer, or watch. This is a MISERABLE flaw since, for just one example, if you use the watch as an alarm clock, you have to get up out of bed and turn on the light to see the darn thing. Ditto for setting the timer countdown for ""snooze alarm"" purposes. If anyone knows of a G-Shock model where the face can be lit while setting it, I'd love to replace this one."

But its rugged enough that this wont hurt it. The buttons are recessed so if you have a puppy, he wont be able to change the time as with the older style. The puppy did change the time a couple of times, when he hit the buttons with his baby teeth, but that wont happen much, its funny. And we really dont anticipate diving to 200 meters, even tho the watch will deal with that depth.

The history that surrounds the Casio G Shock line all kind of stems from this watch- if people imagine a G shock this most likely is the design that would pop into their heads. It has a cool, rugged appeal to it and long-time users can attest to its toughness. For me personally this is my first foray into the G shock world- I have always loved my Suuntos but thought I would give the brand a chance. It is an extremely functional watch but it has some downsides for me. First is the comfort- the band on this thing is hard plastic which tends to dig into your skin after a few hours.. with my Suuntos' rubber straps I forget I am wearing them. The second downside may be more of a personal preference rather than an issue with the watch. I wish it were larger- this is a rather small watch for my wrist, if the face were 50% larger it would be perfect. So make it a little larger and give it a quality rubber strap and it would be 5/5."

As a veteran, G-Shocks aren't new to me (it seems as if all my Corps buddies had one except me). After reading several reviews on this model, I decided to make the splurge. My watch arrived yesterday, and I'm very impressed.  For starters, the watch looks nicer in person.  It has a strong, masculine tough-look about it. Yet, it's classy enough to wear outside the gym or ""field"". Additionally, the watch is extremely durable, and doesn't feel like its made from cheap parts. I definitely recommend. Enjoy!"

Buttons to adjust all functions are indented.  Earlier models (that I have owned) had them extruded.  (think of an inny or outie belly button).  Result:  Very frustrating for fingers of any size to adjust anything on the watch 2.  If, in setting the time for 8:00 for example, you happen to go to 9 you have to continue through the remainer (10-11-12) etc to get back to 8.  The earlier version allowed you simply to back up.  If in fact you could do this with this watch, I could not because of the darn indented button design) 3.  It is difficult to tell if the alarm is in the on/off position and more difficult to tell if the hourly alarm is in the on/off position.  As a side note, who buys a watch with the goal of having an alarm that rings on an h ourly basis?  You may find that an hourly alarm during the nighttime bothers you or, if not you, your BFF.  During the daytime co workers tend not to be fond of that function.  Maybe a light or maybe shading of the watch face to indicate an alarm function is activated would be helpful 4.  A booklet that is so small and at the same time so lengthy it is intimidating.  We are in an internet age.  Put in a o ne page note that says  ""For detailed instructions consult Casio/Net at Watch instructions and download the particular ones you need.  (That would save paper as well) 5.

I've been using the same model for a couple of decades, at least. I've used it to snorkel, do manual labor, to go running, in the gym... It's pretty indestructible. You'll mess up the band before the watch dies. The battery life is years. I've cleaned it by strapping it inside my dishwasher (no hot-dry!). For the price you can't beat it. The only criticism is that it's a pain to set accurately, but when you do it once it keeps time pretty close to perfectly. After that, just the hour for daylight savings changes twice a year. I recommend this very highly."

This was my main ""outdoors & travel"" watch, and I wore it to the office quite a bit. So far the watch is doing just fine - I am still on the original battery, all functions are working (as it should). But there is a weak link with this watch which is its band. My band started to crack around the eyelets and then developed a 1/8"" crack on the side. To replace the band will cost me around $20, and the cost of a new watch (with a new band) is around $40. This watch uses non standard with for bands as well, they are hard to find. My local watchmaker did not have one in stock and said he could order one for me, but I am seriously considering a new watch. For ""indestructible"" watch 3 years is just too short to earn top marks. Fix the band, Casio! On a positive side I used to have Seiko 5 stainless steel watch & band and that used to leave black residue underneath on my sweaty hand. There was some metal to sweat reaction. Casio's metal back never left any marks on my hand."

Not a camera.  Not a thermometer.  I don't need to know when high tide is at my favorite beach break in Costa Rica.  I don't need any cute features which I never use. I mainly wear a watch when I run, and I use the countdown timer feature for intervals.  Having the clock display while in the countdown mode is really useful. I actually set the time, date and timer without even having to use the instructions. How good is that! The buttons are rather stiff, and I can see where that could be a problem if you have big fingers.  But that is a small price to pay for this quality at a reasonable price."

If you want a tough good looking watch this may be it. If you want something cheaper (both price and quality) but easier to use go for the F-201WA (the light of the 201WA is terrible, it is not water proof, only water resistant, but the buttons are great, has all the 5600E functions plus dual time and 5 alarms.

I've banged it against metal racks at work too many times and it took the beatings without problem so far. Mine goes ~30 seconds faster every month. That's not bad at all for a 40-buck watch. That level of accuracy is good enough for me, I don't need sub-second accuracy. So why don't I like it ? This watch meets all my needs, and that's why I don't like it.

But I am somewhat disappointed with three features.  First the little buttons on the sides to control and set the watch are very small and highly recessed.  So using these tiny buttons with your fingers can be tricky and difficult.  Second is that the sound the Alarm function makes is very low in volume.  In fact it is so soft that it does not really wake me up from sleep (and I am not a very deep sleeper).  Finally, setting the watch is not intuitive, and you better have the instructions to read in order to not mess it up.  It would also be nice if the watch would be available in some colors other than black."

This watch keeps great time and has all the important features for me; date/time on easy to read display, good illumination for night viewing, alarm, event timer and rugged design.

They have always lasted over 4-5 years each and I have a solar powered one that is still going strong.  I would still be using it but it had too many bells and whistles and I wanted a simpler g-shock that had only a few features like the alarm and a large display.  This one seemed to fit the bill perfectly.  That's why it also was a great disappointment. The strap broke after the warranty period was over at one year, 2 months.  I was lucky to find a generic replacement that fit, so not a big deal.  However, after one year, 6 months, the display got glitchy where only the bottom half of the numbers displayed.  A local Casio authorized watch repair shop said the battery was probably bad and possibly the lcd.  But the cost to replace just the battery would be close to what I paid for the watch itself and there would be no guarantee on the water resistence.  To send it back to Casio would be just throwing more good money after bad as I would have to pay for all shipping, insurance etc.  Just not worth it for this watch. I understand these are, in fine watch parlance, ""throw away"" watches.  Use them for several years and when they break down, throw them away and buy another.  But at only 1 1/2 years?  I expected much better from Amazon and especially Casio."

When I thought durable, I immediately thought G-Shock.  I wanted something that would be easy to read and not be cluttered up with other information and dials that no normal person uses.  This was the perfect watch.  It gives me the date and time in the time zone I'm in, and I can set an alarm or countdown timer if I want, which could come in handy.  Of course, it has a stop watch which is also useful.  Unfortuntaely, I can't tell you the date, time or tide in Sri Lanka at any given day, but that's A-OK with me.  I give this watch 5 stars."

Myrick","25 Aug 2020","1.0","Is NOT accurate","I bought this watch in 2014 for use when camping and hiking. I had owned a Timex (Expedition) for many years and it served me well and kept accurate time. Unfortunately, I lost that watch and Amazon didn't have a Timex (Expedition) in stock. So, I read the reviews and then bought this Casio. First and foremost, my Casio does NOT and NEVER did keep accurate time. The watch cost me $41.36 in 2014, which was about $10.00 more than the Timex (Expedition). The buttons on this Casio are almost impossible to depress, whereas the buttons on the Timex are a breeze to operate, especially the large light button on the face of the watch. Twice every year, I regret buying this watch. In the spring when I have to set it forward and in the fall when I have to set it back. It typically gains about 10 minutes over that period of time. I've never owned a quartz movement that gained 20 minutes over the course of a year. If you're looking for ease of use and accuracy, I respectfully suggest that you look elsewhere."

It has the four essential timekeeping functions: (1) clock, (2) stopwatch (count up), (3) timer (count down) and (4) alarm - no (in my opinion) unnecessary functions. And, *no* multiple instances, e.g., > 1 timer. This basic setup works for me, although others may desire multiple clocks, for example. I especially like the view of the time when in stopwatch and timer mode. A minor comment: I sometimes find it awkward to access the recessed buttons - although this might be a ""feature"" to prevent you accidentally activating a function. Highly recommended."

You pretty much have to use your nail to press a button. They are hard to press with the pad of your finger. The adjust button (the top left button) takes an unreasonable amount of force. The adjust button is recessed, whereas the other buttons stick out. In order to record a split you have to press the adjust button which is very difficult to do with the watch on your wrist. Also, the previous split time goes away once you hit the adjust button again, and you’re expected to write down the split time in order to record it. This is unacceptable when running races, where you want to keep track of your mile split times. The light only illuminates the screen for two seconds. It feels like a durable watch, but the buttons make the watch fairly useless."

The watch works very well for displaying time, but it does have some functionality issues. When setting the time, a timer, or an alarm the numbers can only be increased. Since I regularly change the timer from 20 minutes to 10 minutes and back again, I would like to have a feature where I could decrease a 20 minute timer to a 10 minute timer without first increasing the timer to 59 minutes and cycling back around. Additionally the adjust button is slightly recessed and it is sometimes difficult to push. Since the watch is functional, but not exceptional, I am giving it a three star review."

I highly recommend buying this watch if you haven't had a G-Shock and wanna enter the realm of the G's ; ) it's great for its price, plus you get the classic Casio quality that comes with it, not to mention that unbeatable old school 80's look.. Which was my selling point to be honest. After you realize wether you like it or hate it, then you can decide wether or not to move up the latter of the more expensive G's. Yoouu knoow!!"

Timekeeping, water resistance, and durability have always been great. I’m the odd guy preferring not to have a wall clock on my wrist and I thought this fit the bill again. This one has been frustrating however. The buttons are not sensitive and don’t work very well. Particularly the upper left one. It works intermittently and often requires using a tool (pen, etc.) to depress it enough to activate it. At first I thought I was just fat fingering around the button causing the issue, but that’s not it.

Another problem is that the adjustment button is lodged in too much so it’s a lot harder to adjust the time settings on this watch. The biggest problem I have with this watch is that it doesn’t have AM time settings which means that I have to change the date manually to stay with accurate time every single day.

Issue 2: if you look at the pictures, there are four silver buttons - two on each side of the watch’s interface. The top left button labeled A in the instruction manual is completely depressed in. To access the options assigned to this button I had to use pen and press down. I believe over time this button will sink deep in the leather contours of the watch.

Looks great, and it's probably indestructible (only had it a couple weeks). It has one MAJOR design flaw though.  The set button is so recessed into the body, you can't push it with your finger.  I have to pop out my pocket knife or pen to use it.  That wouldn't be a big issue, except this button resets/sets the timer, which I use while cooking and during the day quite a bit. It's a pain. And a horrible design flaw. It handicaps an otherwise great watch."

It was disappointing soon after I open the package, since the materials (including the metal knuckle, the plastic band and the metal back) all feel inferior at least one level to my old G-shock.It actually feels more like the $13 Casio watch I bought for my little cousin. I am happy the size and look, but the construction makes me wonder whether it will last."

While looking for a cheaper Timex, I read a review which highly recommmened the Casio G-Shock.  When I read other reviews, they seemed to agree that it was a good eatch, so I decided to try it. Not happy. It's difficult to use, hard to see the numbers, and almost impossible to engage the buttons. One of the complaints about the Timex was that the buttons were too easy to engage. Well, that is definitely not a problem with the Casio. I can hardly press them. I have to use my fingernail, and press really hard to get them to work. I won't ever buy another. This one will last a long time because I don't ever wear it. I bought a cheap Timex Sports, and wear it all the time."

G shock is world renown for its durability. People have stated they have used it for diving, surfing, ect. I’m guessing I got a knock off because this makes NO SENSE. It’s a damm shame because this is one of the reasons I try not to shop on Amazon as much anymore. There’s really no guarantees in situations like this.

I needed to replace one that had served me well for years. Too bad for me that Casio has made changes in its design. In particular, on this model, the Adjust setting button, which is used for selecting the function you want, is slightly recessed and I simply cannot manipulate it easily with my fingertips. Either the mild arthritis I have isn't letting me be nimble enough or my fingers are too big. I can do it with a thumbnail if I get it just right or stylus, but not with my finger tip. Sorry, but that is not what I want. Styling is nice, though, and I still like Casio. Wound up with one of the humongous G-Shock models that has four big buttons. Jerry"

That is if the bands dont deteriorate and snap first.  All band replacements never fit or last properly so you end up getting a new watch because of a new band.  The pins are not the most secure system of making sure the band wont fall off.

I don't know what happened, as I have taken care of it and hardly exposed it to water. Pretty disappointed, though, considering the reviews I read about it being a watch that lasted a long time. Everything else about the watch is just fine. Would have been quite satisfied with it if it had not malfunctioned. Update 12/17/15 - Watch is worse now. If I set an alarm, the alarm rings for half a second and resets the clock time to 12:00AM Friday January 1st. The display is weak and hard to see, especially in certain light. My advice is avoid this watch."

I agree with the reviews that say this watch has everything a watch should, and nothing it shouldn't. I think that is true, if it were 1985. But it is not 1985 any more. I'll start with the bad things first: a) This model, with the E suffix, is not solar powered. This means that eventually, the battery is going to die and need to be replaced. When that happens you need to change it. On one hand, the back is easy to get off. Just get out your jeweler's screwdrivers and remove the four screws. If you are not coordinated with tiny parts, don't try it. Once the back is off, the seal is broken. There is an O-ring between the stainless steel back and the chassis. It is a challenge to make sure that O-ring is back in the same spot. Also, since the CR2016 lithium battery is pretty big and the watch electronics so efficient, the battery lasts a LONG time. Mine lasted 8 years, though I don't wear it every day. With daily wear, it would probably be more like 5 years. b) Next problem.... Oh wait, there are no other problems. The watch is flawless aside from that. The fact that it uses a conventional lithium battery and not solar, coupled with the fact that it is not atomic, means that this watch can be sold for a very fair price. What you get for the price is amazing: a) Ruggedness - This was the original rugged digital watch. Before this came out, the only way to have a rugged watch was to buy a diver's watch. Those were not as rugged as this, nor as affordable. Unlike cheaper and less armored models, this model has a mineral glass crystal that is not as easily scratched as the plastic crystal on the cheaper models. Also, the G-Shock has the rubber armor that protects the crystal from glancing blows. In addition to that, it is 200 m water resistant. This is enough to go swimming with, and even scuba diving. No need to ever take this watch off! b) Accuracy - I believe the spec. for this watch is 30s per month. Mine is more accurate than this. It is so accurate, it only needs to be set once a year. No need for atomic receivers to add cost. c) Features - It has just the right amount of features. The time & calendar are all visible on the main screen; most of the time I don't even need to press any buttons. Stopwatch, for those times when I want to time something. How long does it take to ride my bike to the train station? How long before my food is served when I eat out? The countdown timer is even more useful. I use it to remind myself to change laundry and for portable cook times for steak on the grill. Dual time. Came in handy when I was in Poland early this year. One alarm, but it is a very special alarm. You can set it to go off every day at a certain time or on a certain day every month, or on a certain day in a certain month. d) Not too clunky - A lot of the newer G-Shocks are much thicker and with more corners and edges. This one is big, but it still fits under shirt sleeves. My other G-Shock (the first solar/atomic model) is probably 20% bigger. It has a couple of useless features and cost twice as much. e) Comfort - Although it has the typical Casio resin strap, it is comfortable and it doesn't break. The strap is already molded in the shape of of your wrist. This is good, because it means the strap is not getting bent again and again every time you put on or take off the watch. This feature is common to all G-Shocks. Lesser Casios don't have this and folks say that the watches themselves last forever, but the straps do not. Casio needs to get on board with nylon straps, I think. Although solar/atomic is not a required feature, they make this same watch style in a solar/atomic version. It costs more, but I think it is worth it just so that one doesn't have to worry about breaking the seal to replace the battery and not getting it back right. Technically, one is supposed to replace that gasket and clean it every time the battery is changed. But no one ever does, except Casio. If you can afford it, get the solar/atomic model, unless you really want the original!"

I’ve gone through several other watches and none have out lasted this one. The screen isn’t scratched to bad considering what I put it through.  The buttons are a little hard to press with big sausage fingers like mine but that’s only really a problem when daylight saving time hits and I need to change the time. I wish the resin band held up better but for the price I can’t really complain. Other than that if you need a watch that can take a beating this is the way to go."

I love that when I'm in the 'countdown' or 'stopwatch' function that the current time is still viewable in the little inset window thing.  That's really useful when timing a run, but also keeping track of what time it is, so I know when I need to head home. I think it looks cool, but it's light weight. Tough, but not, like ""Don't mess with me or I'll bludgeon you with my watch.""  It feels good on the wrist- but not as good as a watch with a silicone band, like my Garmin Instinct- that's a really comfortable watch.  I love how well it slips under the cuff of a long-sleeve shirt.  The light is great.  I wish you could turn off the key-beep, and I wish the alarm was a little louder. I took the bezel off and hit it with the Dremel tool and some fine wet-dry sandpaper and knocked down some of the knobbys that make it hard to get to the buttons (see photos).  It's now really easy to get to that top-left button- and to get all the other ones just by feel.  After doing that mod to the make the buttons easier to get to, the ONLY complaints I have about this watch are that the sheen of the bezel and the strap don't *perfectly* match.  Every now and again the band gets to looking more glossy than the bezel, so I hit it with some 600 grit sandpaper- and that gets it back to more of a matte finish.  Also, the digits get ghosty on more viewing angles than other watches I have. My Rangeman and my Instinct are just viewable from anywhere.  It's a small thing, but I notice it.  I wish it had more than one alarm.  I've contemplated getting a GW-5610 for more alarms, button mute and (hopefully) digits that are bolder and viewable from more angles- but it's more than twice the price and the current time doesn't appear in the inset window when you're in stopwatch or timer mode.  So that sucks.  I don't wish it had world time.  I know a lot of people need that- and some of my other watches have that- it just feels like one more function to click through to get to the function I want. All the obvious things are there- it keeps super-reliable time, everything works, it's comfy, and people who know watches will all tell you- whatever else you've got in terms of watches, you should have one of these too.  They're right. This watch has held up perfectly to bathroom demolitions, yard work, car work, field work, hiking, camping, really, really crappy surfing, snorkeling after I found out I suck at surfing, rock climbing / rappelling and multi-day trips where it serves as alarm clock, navigation timer and 'don't forget to do 'X' reminder' thingy.  I like it a lot.  When I'm getting ready for the day, I choose to wear it about as often as my GW-9400 Rangeman, which is a fantastic watch but bulky, and my Instinct- which is also a fantastic watch, but it makes me just a little nervous to have $300 swinging around on my arm- but I LOVE that watch too. So, like I say: other watches do more.  Most of the time, I don't need more and this thing just works great, looks cool and it's solid.  If I lost or destroyed the one on my wrist right now, I'd buy another one tomorrow."

Historically, this has been the point where I toss the old watch out or back in the drawer and buy a new one.  This time, though, I thought I'd see how hard it is to replace a watch battery and see if I could bring it back to life.  After a few errant tries and watching a YouTube video or two, I was able to and this old thing is now running as well as ever (or almost). This is my go-to outdoor/hiking/workout watch and I also wear it when travelling since I don't care if it gets lost/damaged and also doesn't advertise ""rob me"" to any crooks looking to take advantage of a tourist.  It's easy to set and probably quite close to being bulletproof.  I wear it when swimming, in the hot tub, or when washing the car.  At this point, I'm almost daring the universe to destroy or damage it and so far it has not risen to the challenge. The years seem to have been tough on this watch, as there is no audible 'beep' function on it anymore.  I suspect this could be because of the discount battery I used to replace the OEM version, or perhaps that circuit is dead.  No worries.  I have plenty of alarms around me on my nightstand and on my smartphone.  I also cracked the plastic ""G-Shock"" wrap that goes around the case, which is why this G-Shock doesn't look quite like all the others.  I like this (literally) stripped-down version better, anyhow.  It's lighter and now the buttons poke out of the sides like Frankenstein's neck.  Coincidentally, I've named this watch ""Frank"" or ""Silent Frank"" since it doesn't make any noise.  Take that, Rolex."

As someone who uses that button to reset the Stopwatch often when at the gym, it became a pain to have to deal with.  I really like the watch other than that, though, so I came up with a ""fix"" that works for me so far.  I simply went to the hardware store and bought some JP Weld, mixed some up and -- using a small wooded toothpick -- applied a small bead of it to the recessed ""Adjust"" button.  Not too much, just a small amount, and let it harden for as long as the JP Weld instructions say, and it works perfectly.  I no longer have to struggle to reset the Stopwatch or the Timer.  The dark gray color of the JP Weld matches the black of the watch itself.  Note:  You might have to apply more than one bead of the JP Weld to make it ""tall"" enough to make pushing the button easy.  Just apply a little at a time (under do it rather than over do it) until you reach the desired result."

It is slim and compact. It can take massive amounts of punishment and still keep going on. It is extremely lightweight and comfortable. The current time is visible in all modes. The only reason that I, personally, rate it a 4? You cannot mute this watch. Otgerwise it is perfect. I do want to take some space and address some ""flaws"" that other reviewers have mentioned. 1. The adjust button being sunken into the case is an error or fluke. Nope, this is the way it is designed. I have rather large fingers so I must use a pen or key, or whatever I have handy. Why is this a design feature? It is so you will not accidentally change the time or other settings on your watch. 2. My watch foggs up when it gets cold and or wet. Yes, this is a pain when ot happens. Also these watches are hermatically sealed when they are assembled. But, the humidity and air pressure present at the day and time these were assembled at the factory plays a large factor. Most of the time you will not have any issues on this front. But if the watch is fogging after getting it wet is an easy fix. Simply get a small screwdriver and remove the 4 screws to the back plate and remove it. Make sure the thin gasket is in the correct position, which is the thin circle running around the back of the watch under the backplate. Leave the back off for a half hour to fourty five minutes on a normal day where you happen to live. Once you make sure the gasket is in place, and get the back back in place your watch will be fine. Now if it is fogging due to cold, doing the above can and will help most of the time. I mean for crying out loud, it's a $40 watch. Not a $400 or a Rolex."

Women will not fantasize about how big and hard your wallet is when they see the G-Shock.  It looks terrible with a leisure suit, and worse with a tuxedo.  Donald Trump would mot be caught dead with one.  It will not impress anyone at a power meeting in a corporate board room.  Really does not go with the outfit if you are a male stripper with Chippendale's or a clown with Barnum and Bailey. The G-Shock does have a few minor benefits.  Mine has been deeper than 300' repeatedly with me on deep techical dives, working flawlessly.  I never got deep enough for the pressure to kill it, and I have been deep.  Indeed, before reliable dive computers were developed, the G-Shock was favored by the deep and cave diving pioneers because it actually kept working at extreme depths, unlike a lot of big name watches that were supposed to.  So this thing will put up with far more water than most watches, regardless of price. And there is also the tiny benefit of shock resistance, but is that just slick advertising?  Well, years ago when I was a lot younger, my buddies and I would get the idea that we should torture-test the watch to see if it was really shock resistant.  There may have been quite a bit of beer involved, but I have no clear recollection of that.  It survived falls off off 6-story buildings (okay, it was forcefully thrown downwards from those heights after the first couple falls).  My friend with the pitcher's arm threw it out the window of a speeding car as hard as he could, hitting traffic signs.  Over cliffs, over whatever.  The case would be ragged, but the watch would keep running fine . . . UNLESS something hard and pointed went through the glass face.  That was the only thing that would do in the watch, and it was not easy to have that happen. We ran over it a few times with the car, which jacked up the band but didn't phase the module. It did totally fail when shot with a .22, though the back of the case could withstand all air rifles.  Yeah, we wasted some money on the 5 or 6 watches we did in over the years trying to find what the limits were, but the beer cost more. Basically, this watch will survive depths and impacts far worse than you could ever possible survive.  Which is another failure for the watch: the coroner will not get a good time of death from your watch because it won't stop like everyone elses when your plane crashes.  He might even steal it because he is so impress that it survived . . . and he doesn't have to worry about the water hurting it as he washes your blood and gore off the watch. But it still won't make women think you have a lot of money."

Remember the old TV commercial that established G-Shock durability by showing a hockey player sending a DW-5200 G-Shock flying with a slapshot? I bought one way back then, and gave it a terrible beating for years and years. It was made in Japan and had a threaded back that screwed onto the case. This DW-5600 is the grandson of that one and looks practically identical. The DW5600E-1V is made in Thailand, and its back is attached by 4 screws. But other than those distinctions and a few minor text changes, it is the same watch, with the same durability. I have a watch box filled with timepieces, but this is the one I wear whenever I'm doing any manual labor because I know it can take the beating."

But really is it? Sure there are more expensive of the series. Models with solar panels, solar panels and Multi-band (atomic) setting, and the most expensive are the metal body ones. Casio releases several ""special limited"" G shocks. They have different colored bands or graphics. They are only offered for a limited run. Here is the kicker: Some of them use the same #3229 module as the ""base"" DW5600E-1V. So in reality you are just paying more for a different colored band and a watch face with different colors or graphics. For example, a few years ago Casio released thier ""Clean military series"". They retailed for $99. They had a solid color band, yellow, white, or black and a white face. They were called clean because the face was white with minimal lettering. I have a yellow one. But it uses the same #3229 module. So for twice the cost of the DW5600E-1V, the only difference was the band, case color and the white face. I've seen some Casio limited editions which use the same module go for $140. So the question is, is the DW5600E-1V REALLY a ""base"" model?"

Most G-Shocks are too big and bulky for my taste but having recently discovered the much more reasonably sized and classically retro-nerd styled 5600s I began to take a closer look.  I was initially considering the GW5600J-1 but the fact that it doesn't display both the day and date simultaneously was a serious drawback for me.  (At this point I'd not yet discovered the GWM5600-1.)  Then after reading reviews of the non-gimmicky DW5600E-V1 I convinced myself that it was really the best way to go and that solar power and atomic syncing were extras I really didn't need. A couple of days after ordering the DW5600E-1V I discovered the GWM5600-1 and found that it was everything  I had initially been looking for and ended up ordering it as well.  Both arrived safely and now I am the proud owner of two nearly identically looking watches.  Chances are no one but me will ever know. I think I'll call one Borden and one Fallon.  However, they are not nearly identical... Weight: My DW5600 weighs 52g and the GWM5600 weighs 48g. Size: They look the same to me except that the GWM is slightly thinner at just under 12mm. The DW is about 12.5mm. Display: This is where I found the biggest and most unexpected differences.  The GWM has noticeably better contrast.  The background (light grey) of the DW is darker than on the GWM resulting in poorer contrast making it just a bit harder to read. Also the main numbers of the display are slightly larger on the GWM. Combine the larger numbers with the better contrast and the GWM's display is a no contest winner. (Of course if I didn't have them side by side to compare I'm sure I'd have had nothing bad to say about the DW's display.) Buttons: As you may already know the top left (A) button on the DW is more recessed than the other three, actually it really doesn't protrude out at all, and can be difficult to use.  I usually have to try two or three times to get it to respond.  I understand the need to avoid inadvertent pushing and activating of functions but this seems a bit too extreme to me.  The GWM (A) button extends out as far as the others and has caused me no problems at all. The backs of both are stainless steel attached with four screws.  The DW's back is plain and round and just fine thank you very much but the back of the GWM has a bit nicer brushed finish and a more sculpted shape giving it a subtle if somewhat intangible superiority over the DW's back.  At least I think so. As far as features go, I wanted a watch that displayed both the day and date in time keeping mode.  I wanted at least one alarm and a countdown timer (one hour is plenty for me).  Either Solar or battery power is fine with me because I know that the cells in BOTH will eventually need replacing and taking the back off my watch once every several years is something that I do not consider unreasonable. It is of course cool to have your watch reset itself every night and to know that it will never be more than a second or two off the real correct time.  I live in Canada but here in southern Alberta I have no trouble getting a strong signal every night and am even able to do manual resets during the day. In the end I am happy to have two 5600s and will wear both I'm sure.  If I had to do it over again though, I'd definitely just get the GWM5600-1.  It's barely noticeably lighter, thinner, it's easier to read and will always show the correct time without manual adjustment. It's pretty much perfect!"

To summarise - I actually bought a DW5600-E in 1998.  So it is now about 20 years old. It's had the strap replaced once (in 2005) and it is now on its 3rd or 4th battery. The batteries (CR2016) seem to last a lot longer than the advertised 2 years. It is still going strong and looks hardly any different than the day I bought it. It gets used a lot for the gym, washing the car, gardening, day to day stuff - everything really. It appears to be 100% waterproof. When I first bought it I thought it was a bit big and chunky. Nowadays with the fashion for much bigger watches than this, it doesn't seem that way anymore. Funny how your view can change - I now find it the perfect size - not too big, not too small. The display is clear and the backlight is very good. I use the countdown timer a lot ( whilst cooking, for example ). I've read a couple of people complaining about the stiffness of the buttons especially the recessed one. Well, all I can say is mine was like this too, but give it 10 years and they will loosen up. This is a long term watch! Overall, I like mine even more these days than when I bought it 1998. It could be a nostalgia thing but I can't see me ever not having this watch. Finally, on the last battery change, I took mine to a jewellers to sort out. They handed it back to me a few days later to say sorry, it's not working at all :-(  After a Google I found that there is a little contact point near the battery cage (it is apparently called the AC or All Clear) which you can reset using metal tweezers if you replace the battery and find the watch is not working or working correctly. Without much hope I tried this out myself, and the watch instantly sprung back to life! What a brilliant feeling - welcome back (for another 20 years?) ...."

From timing rest breaks in between sets, or a Crossfit workout, or laps on the track, the stopwatch function gets serious use. The mode toggle and the start/stop buttons work well. It's the reset button that kills me. I've used it enough that I can hit it first try 9/10 times, but the button is recessed for some reason and is far from an ideal setup for a function that I use so often. It works well enough however that even though it's not perfect I continue to love this watch. What else can I say that hasn't already been said? It's got classic, retro style. It's more or less bombproof. The cultish mystique is undeniable. What other $50 watch has this much history? Keanu Reeves wore it in Speed. It's been certified by NASA and sent to space... I'm definitely a bit of a nerd, but for a watch of this quality at this price, I can overlook the less than perfect stopwatch function."

I always travel with it, to supplement my nice watches...you don't want to take your expensive swiss watch into a waterpark (for example) or on any other rough and tumble activity. Unlike some of the other G Shocks this is quite subtle and thin.  Large numerals, basic operations and the illuminator make it very suitable.  My only reasoning for docking one star for this is that Casio has changed the functionality of the watch with the new module.  I have had many pre G watches which had a superior and more ergonomically sound module...like the 270 (I think).  Here, we have lost the second time zone, which was very useful and the button functions have moved about.  So if you are a old Casio watch owner, there is a bit of a learning curve to unlearn old stuff. Nonetheless this is the watch that I reach for when I want to keep something on my wrist that will tell time accurately and reliably and is ""disposable"""

This is not just a MAN watch.  I am a lady and I like this watch because it is user friendly, durable, reliable, classic design.  It lights up evenly across the screen for a second or two or for as long as you depress the button.  I like the count down timer, not available on the less expensive models.  I Like the size, not huge, bulky, or heavy. Unlike the less expensive models, the crystal is glass (mineral) rather then plastic.  I have owned Rolex, Omega, Seiko, Citizen, Swiss Army Victorinox,  None of them have kept time as accurately as this watch.  The batteries in those watches last a year or two, while the battery lasts approx. 5 - 7 years or more in this 5600E watch.  The band wraps nicely around my wrist and i like to wear it loose like a bracelet.  As the testimonies tell, it will stand up to extreme abuse. Let me compare it to the model I purchased before this one, the W-800H which I purchased for $15.00 + tax + postage. Yes, it is a very good watch.  10 year battery, ""Plastic"" crystal.  Even though the watch is a bit thinner, if feels more bulky because the band does not have the same wrap around design. No count down timer, which is very useful for me. Does not have ""rubberized"" protection around the face (very attractive, by the way) Water resistant only to 100 as apposed to 200 meters. I think the W-800M has dual time and split timer.  I don't care about that, so I can't vouch for it.  I want my count down timer. MY VERY FAVORITE OF THE TWO is the G-Shock DW-5600 E.  If you search Amazon, then Casio G-Shock 3229, you will come up with this watch.  I don't know why they call it  DW-5600E-1V but it is the same watch. Navy Seals and other Special Forces:) wear this watch in Afghanistan etc.  and rave about its durability and reliability. I recommend this watch for everyone from Grandchildren to grandparents, from teacher to construction worker. Hope this is helpful."

I have worn it for about a week, and I have come to the conclusion that it's a great watch. It's so light I really don't notice that I'm wearing it. It's simple to use with no added fluff that complicates things. So far it's very durable. I'm a Firemedic and tend to be hard on my gear and this watch had stood up to the punishment, but I need more time so see if it can hold up to my abuse. I also like the simplicity of the stopwatch feature; it will be a valuable tool on certain EMS related calls. The only con is that the reset button in the upper left corner is recessed in pretty far and can be a little tricky to push with medical gloves on. All in all, as of now I would highly recommend this watch to anyone in the market for a work or duty watch. I'm editing my review for a word of caution, and I'm taking a star away. I am still very happy with this watch. It is still very tough impact wise because I have not seen a scratch or ding, but I found out it doesn't hold up to insect repellant. While preparing for a hike I sprayed myself with off to keep the ticks away. I got some over spray on the bevel and the band. I noticed some discoloration so I rinsed it with water. The spray marks are now permanent. The crystal and the function are still fine so it's all cosmetic, but I am reminded of my hiking trip every time I check the time."

The band should last longer with the screws than the pins on the cheaper Casio I still have. The only shortcoming I found is the digits are a bit smaller and harder to read than on the cheaper model. My eyesight is not what it used to be (I'm 50). This will be my daily watch for work and casual outings...that is if I get used to the slightly smaller display. For under $40 it's a lot of watch.

Webster","20 Feb 2009","5.0","My personal perfect watch","This 5600 has everything I need, and nothing I don't: - It tells you the time, date, and day of the week at a glance. - It has 1 alarm (not 5 like many other G-Shocks -- too fidly). - A countdown timer (with the current time shown in the upper box). - A stopwatch (again, time is still shown). That's it. If you want fancy ""features"" like inaccurate temperature readings, barometric pressure graph which gets distorted by temperature and altitude, 19 alarms, and world time in 7,000 cities around the world -- look elsewhere! This watch does exactly what a wristwatch should, which in my opinion is tell the time, and take an absolute beating. I don't particularly want to stand in public pressing 15 buttons on my watch, just to set a quick alarm to remind me of something. This 5600 keeps everything relatively simple (obviously go through the manual when you first get it). (I started collecting G-Shocks; they have all since been given away/sold since I discovered this little beauty. I had a Riseman, Gulfman, Mudman, and G7700 -- and none of them were worn after purchasing this. And I paid AUS$350 for the Riseman!) The design of this watch is absolutely classic. It is truly a ""timeless"" design for a digital watch. The best thing about it is the simplicity -- it is one of the few G-Shocks which doesn't have random circles which show the seconds, bar graphs, a bezel 2 inches off your wrist, etc etc. It's clean and simple. As far as durability, I haven't taken mine off for over 6 months; it's been swimming indoors, at the beach, smashed against shelving time and time again (I'm a storeman), it gets run under hot water about 10 times a day for hand-washing, I shower in it, sleep in it, play with my kids at the park ... It is yet to show ANY visible damage -- absolutely amazing! The buttons are fine to press. After setting the alarm, starting the stopwatch, whatever, it returns you to the time mode with a single button push. Again, there is no nonsense, like scrolling through 5 more modes just to get back to the time display. If you are also looking at the ""solar atomic"" model of the 5600, please consider -- the batteries in this watch will last years and years, and it will keep very accurate time (I reset it against Internet atomic time every few months and it's never been out by more than a few seconds). In my opinion solar & atomic are essentially ""gimmicks"" in wristwatches (no offense to those that enjoy those features, but, I see them as useless, and I have owned a solar G-Shock). I 100% recommend this watch for the no-nonsense buyer who wants a relatively slim/sleek G-Shock with all the toughness, and non of the ""fluff""."

I originally bought it to wake me up for work and had no clue that a year later I would be depending on it every day. I have my timer set up for steaks and laundry, I use my stop watch when I go for bike rides, and I have never had to worry about it even once when it rains or if I go swimming. At first I was worried that hot water might make a difference but after hot tubing with this watch for a year I realized it’s indestructible. My sisters dog got ahold of it and buried it in my parents back yard, my dad found it and gave it back to me covered in mud, worked the exact same as when I first got it and none of the buttons have ever had a single problem. I kept the instruction manual in my wallet and every time I got board I learned a little more about it until I finally learned the watch completely. The hourly alarm keeps me on track at work and my daily alarm let’s me know when it’s time for lunch without any problems. I’ve never changed a single battery and I don’t think I ever will at this point."

This style dates back to the 80s and hasn't changed much since. This is a very tough watch and has many applications, from your average Joe to the military use. The battery life last a very long time and will keep you company for many years to come. One thing I really like about this watch is its size; it's not ridiculously big like the other Casio G-shock watches. I took off one star because of the band. It either fits tight or loose, but that is just for my wrist. It might fit other people better."

Shipley","28 Sep 2013","5.0","Best features for the price","This watch gets a 5 star review as it is now the best watch for the price on Amazon. I own a GW5600J-1 G-Shock Atomic Tough Solar Watch that used to be sold on Amazon for about $60 when I purchased it.  The price for that model then went up to about $85 which was ""too much"" in my opinion, and now that model says it is out of stock and no indications that it will be brought back at a reasonable price.  The added features of getting solar power and atomic clock syncronization were something that motivated me to say YES I would spend an extra $20 just for the novelties. So where does that put the DW5600E-1V ""classic"" G-Shock watch?  Well, the next step up to get any sort of atomic clock sync is the GWM5610-1 that is $123.54 (as of this writing) on Amazon.  An extra $80 or so to get solar power and atomic clock sync?  No, not worth a 3x price in my opinion.  That clock sync is 6 bands that aren't specified in the item description so I am assuming it is 2x in Japan, the USA clock in Colorado, something in the UK, something in Germany, and then two others have to fit in there somehow.  I don't travel the world enough to care about syncing my watch wirelessly in different continents. Save the money and spend the $45 or so to get the basic G-Shock watch.  NO ONE cares about atomic clock sync.  I thought I did until I bought mine but just came to the realization that wearing a quartz watch that you set right keeps you within a minute of reference time signals for over 6 months before it drifts enough to be signifigant.  If you want to be a geek about it, sync the watch manually by resetting the seconds to a time signal once a month.  Other than that, I DON'T CARE about anything in a watch other than being close to the right time, and then I value durability and water resistance.  So . . . this basic G-Shock watch meets those three criteria for $45. Buy this watch and forget about the atomic clock sync nonsense, and forget about the solar power.  Just get the battery replaced once every 7-10 years and enjoy owning a watch you can beat up and otherwise forget about."

I chose between it and the DW-9052. I liked the shape of the 9052, but the shrouded buttons were more annoying to use and the stopwatch start/stop on that watch is located on the lower right button and I prefer it on the upper right, as on this 5600. I also like the no-nonsense look of this watch without all the extra frippery of some other G-Shocks (which can be fun in its own right, just not what I was looking for with this purchase). The watch is as solidly well built as everyone says. It's a joy to hold--has a reassuring weight and sparkling clear glass dial. The strap is good for what it is. It's not as soft as cloth or leather, but for a resin strap it feels quite comfortable. The buttons don't protrude much--this is by design, especially the Adjust button, to avoid accidental presses or impacts to the buttons. They're not difficult to press but you have to use the tip of your finger or your fingernail to push them, and the Adjust button can be a little harder to get to because it is sunken in more than the others. Features are fairly basic by today's standards, but solid. It has blue-green electroluminescent backlighting with a dedicated button (lower right), and it stays on about two seconds with a quick press. There's one alarm which can be set for as a normal alarm, or to go off the same time each day of a certain month, or to go off on a particular date (month/day). There is a countdown timer that can be set for up to 24 hours and can be set down to the second. It can be set to automatically restart once it goes off. If you like, you can have the backlight flash repeatedly when the alarm or timer goes off, as a visual indicator. There is a stopwatch that can do a split time (stop and record a time while the stopwatch is still counting, then resume at the actual elapsed time) and a first/second-place finish time, but does not have lap memories like my old Timex Ironman Triathlon. I don't often need lap memories, but there are times when they are handy and I wish this watch had that feature. Perpetual calendar up through 2099, which should do me. :) There's also an hourly chime that you can turn on and off. I don't think there's a way to silence the beeping when you change modes, but it's pretty quiet. Modes cycle Time--Alarm--Countdown Timer--Stopwatch, then back to Time, with a different tone at Time so you know you're back even without looking. A useful feature is that when you go to a different mode and use that mode, the next time you press Mode it takes you back to Time. If you select a mode but don't use it (start the stopwatch, set the alarm, etc.), it cycles through the rest of the modes as usual with each button push. In Timer and Stopwatch the time is also displayed (instead of the date in the upper-right part of the display), which I really like since you can time something while still keeping an eye on the time of day and not need to switch modes to do so. You can switch between 12 and 24-hour time, but only in the time-setting mode, and it takes several button pushes. This watch does not have dual time, multiple alarms, lap memory, a timer that will count down and then start counting up, auto-backlighting when you tilt your wrist, or other special features. It's a fairly basic watch that has simple but useful capabilities. It's major selling point is that it is built like a tank. Many digital watches feel disposable. This one does not. If the bezel gets scratched up too badly you can buy a replacement bezel. Same with the strap. Although some worry about water resistance after changing a watch battery, I plan to do my own battery changes and be reasonably careful, and don't anticipate problems (it takes a CR2016 lithium if you're curious). You can buy replacement rubber gaskets if the one inside the back gets too deteriorated over time and you're worried about it leaking. The deepest I will probably take my watch is a swimming pool, and I think it will do fine even after opening and re-closing, but I won't test it until I have to. As others have mentioned, the strap attachments are very narrow for such a big watch--looks like around 15mm. Not a big deal, though, because you can buy special adapters from Casio or other companies that allow you to put say a 22 or 24mm nato strap on this watch. The strap it comes with is 26mm wide where it joins the case of the watch. The watch is pretty heavy for a digital--I do notice it on my wrist, but it hasn't been too bad so far for prolonged wear. Because the actual watch module is recessed in the case and there's some clearance behind the dial glass, the LCD can be hard to read from an angle. It only looks super crisp from head on and slight side angles. Anything more and it's still readable but much softer looking. I'm still getting used to this watch. It's not 100% love at first sight, but I find it very satisfying to wear and to use. I love tools that are built to a purpose without anything extra, and that's the feeling this watch gives me. It doesn't do everything, but what it does it does well. I believe I will have this for a long time to come. At the time of this review, Target's price was only a couple dollars more than the best deal on Amazon. With sales tax it was around $5 more than from Amazon. Of course, prices change all the time, but Amazon seems to have bigger discounts on some of the more expensive G-Shocks (where the margins are probably higher for retail stores)."

Spooky.","I haven't bought one of these in years, and I'm too old to read digital watches any more. But I loved this watch. It was my alarm clock for almost two years, when I couldn't afford an alarm clock (but had to have a watch). I didn't use the light much. I was amazed that it kept ""ticking"" for 13 years (and a couple of years after that when I switched to analog). It was spooky how long that battery lasted. Like, Green Lantern (I said I'm old) spooky. Like nuclear submarine spooky. The buttons for switching between modes were (and are?) intuitive, and provide tons of functionality. Count-up, count-down timers. Alarms. Dates accounted for leap years (again, kind of spooky). Not sure if it passed the Y2K leap year test (it's been that long). This is a great watch. Or was, in any case. Plus, waterproof. SCUBA down to 95 feet, some of which was spent working underwater. Repeatedly. I still have this watch, maybe I should put a new battery in it. If I were in the market for a digital watch, this would be the one. Or just a new battery for my old one."

Every g-shock is made to very tough standards, so to get one at this price is really amazing.  It also has 200m water resistance, like every other g-shock made.  I've heard that if you don't use the light too often, the battery on this watch may last from 5-10 years.  The watch will survive any wear you put it through.  One nice added feature is that the light will stay on for as long as you keep the light button pressed. One note, the top left button is recessed so that it cannot be accidentally pressed.  That is not a flaw - it was designed that way.  I have never had trouble pressing it with my fingernail.

Regardless, I thought I'd only wear this on the days I'm doing something outdoorsy but this watch feels SOOO good on the wrist, and in my opinion is of amazing quality. I've worn many watches in my life, and this one is by far the most sleek and simple. Not too bulky, very retro and I like that classic look a lot, but also modern at the same time.  Easy to use. Gives you everything you need and nothing you don't. I was looking at so many other watches like the cheaper non-gshock casio's, but i'm glad this is what i decided to get. A STEAL. This looks like it'll make it through basic military training in a few weeks, and it won't be catching any long sleeve military uniform/or any long sleeve shirt/sweater.

ADDENDUM: I recently learned of a related product that some may find useful.  It is on Amazon under ""Speidel 16mm Band Fits Casio GShock DW 5600E"". I ordered one but haven't received as yet; $10 including shipping. Advertised as black leather band combined with either yellow or red color material. Looks rugged enough and reviews have said it is but can't comment yet. Will report back in few weeks. Please do yourself a huge favor and read G. Webster's ""My personal perfect watch"" review of 5600E. There is not a single mistatement of fact, no fluff, no nonsense, nothing but 100% honest and accurate evaluation. Date of his review is 2/20/09 and here I am over three years later finding it to still be the most helpful review one could find. I have owned GShocks for past 20+ years in addition to my 15 year old Seiko that I treasure. Two of my three GShocks have been 5600E's, the most recent purchased earlier this month. The 5600E is the perfect basic blocking-and-tackling watch. Full of necessary and helpful features (like your most useful and relied upon multi-tool/army knife), but no frills or wasted features to complicate things. Why am I still buying new GShocks? One of treats is to pass a used but still perfect product like this on to another grateful owner...they never forget. And for those complaining about the size and small print instruction booklet from Casio, do yourself another huge favor...go to Amazon and look up Carson pocket-size, LED light, magnifier. Mine is a couple of years in service now and I couldn't live without it. Cost less than $15 (maybe less than $10). Too bad I didn't get a new module of memory along with my purchase!! Time to climb down from the podium. Remember 5600E GShock (and if you're ready for it, a Carson battery LED pocket/purse magnifier). Thank me and G. Webster later!"

The only way to kill this watch is to destroy the display.  I put bars on mine to minimize that risk. 2. All the functions you need; none that you don't.  Time, calendar, stopwatch, countdown timer, alarm, and backlight.  99% of people will need nothing more, and the lack of superfluous functions and display complications means you aren't bogged down digging through functions to find what you need. 3. Rugged styling, but not overkill.  The watch is tough and looks tough, but it isn't so bulky and aggressive that it jumps out and looks ridiculous with normal attire.  I have baby wrists that make many other G-Shocks look ridiculous, and I can still pull off this watch. Despite the modest price point, this watch will do as much or more than many watches costing literally 200x as much.  There might be other reasons to get other digital watches (need for a particular function, aesthetics, etc) but as far as functionality is concerned, the DW4500 and its relatives are the greatest digital watches on the planet (and in space, because NASA uses them too)."

This is just warm-up for the other suffering I put it through. 2.) Worked as a dishwasher, plunging my hands (and the watch) into an extremely hot bleach solution for a few hours every night for a year. 3.) Worked in an oil refinery, exposing the watch to chemicals and frequent impacts from climbing ladders, etc. 4.) Worked in a lab, frequently using 100% acetone and 100% alcohol to clean things.  I am sure these were splashed on the watch more than once. 4.) Went sailing frequently, beating the watch against the boat and immersing it in salt water. 5.) Went diving to over 100 ft several times.  Pushed buttons underwater at that depth. I have not had to replace the battery yet. Unlike others here, I cannot say it is perfect.  The glass has one scratch on it and the band is beginning to crack.  In addition, the black rubber case shows spots (they look like water spots) from when I applied bug spray (40% Deet) a few years ago.

For 2 of those years, it was inaccurate, its brand name everywhere was starting to annoy me, and the weight it had became cumbersome after i started swimming again. On the third year i had it, it stopped working on the seconds hand and by then, I was looking at better watches for $50+. When i came to Amazon, and was looking at reviews of good reliable watches, I think the casio dw 5600e had ~4 1/2 stars with 850+ people reviewing it. That was a year ago. Just to make it clear, i bought the dw 5600e at Walmart, but i check Amazon for reviews. I'm sure many other people do that as well. Sure it wasn't as visually appealing as the 8926, but for the year i had it, it only gain +1 min. And it had date and day of week on its face, so i can easily say I really like this watch for my needs. I've seen reviews here on people who whine about the top left button being 'far too' recessed. I can reach it fine, whenever i use it. The stopwatch and timer on the watch have been used to varying degrees, but not to professional levels. I haven't used the alarm yet, but i might get to it eventually. Also, whenever I swim, its like its not there at all. Actually, when i wear it in general, i dont feel any of its weight. Overall, its a great change to my previous watch. Invicta may have better watches, like its Reserve line, but i think I'll stick with this watch. It's a simple watch with the accuracy that one would need for everyday life and strength to take anything you dish out to it."

It is very rugged and can survive many smashes and drops. Not only can it survive a drop, but it is also waterproof. Usability: This watch can be used for anything. Whether it is going to school, to work, or even to something more elegant. Like a wedding or even something smaller like a date night with your boy/girlfriend. As said before, it is rugged and waterproof. Perfect for outdoor activities like hiking, rock climbing, and even swimming! (Just don't go deeper than 200meters lol) Watchface/Features: This watch is very simple. Easy on the eyes and has everything that you ever need on a watch unlike some of their other lineups that include the altitude, another clock for a different country, etc. This has the simple: time (hh:mm:as), date (XX/XX), and as well as the day of the week (Mon-Sun). The watch has very small markings along the sides that lets the user what each button does which is a very useful touch and another useful feature on the watch is the Electro Luminescent Backlight which lights up the screen allowing the user to see the time and date in the dark. If you need a simple watch to wear to whatever occasion comes along your way, then this is the perfect watch for you. - Nick Salvador"

It has been the first thing on in the morning and the last thing off at night. Just because the price is cheap does not by any means qualify it as a cheap watch as far as quality. For the last three years, I have been swimming in a pool with it on for hours at a time. I have exposed it to hundreds of hours of being underwater. This watch takes all of the abuse that chlorine and other harsh chemicals expose it to. If you put it back together incorrectly or mess up the gasket that seals the cover, it may fog up a bit when underwater for a while. As long as you don't clumsily close the cover after replacing the battery, this watch is ready for any water experience. The weakest link is the watch band. I had the original one on for about four years, but eventually the harsh pool chemicals greatly degraded its strength. Putting a new band on is easy to do and should only take ten minutes. Other than that, the G-Shock will last. I have replaced the battery twice, and it is very easy to do with just four screws on the back. It gives a very nice warning to replace the batteries before it completely dies. For example, if the light is dim when turning on the illumination, then it is time to replace the batteries. If you don't use the light often, then you will not need to replace the battery for a very long time. I have found one feature especially useful. One night while camping, I had to find my way back to camp. It was pitch black out, and I forgot my flashlight. Luckily I was wearing my G-Shock that night. The light on this watch was actually powerful enough to illuminate the path for me to avoid tripping. You shouldn't replace your flashlight with this watch, but it does an excellent job as an emergency light. I won't soon forget the survival abilities packed into this watch. If you are concerned about the stereotype that G-Shocks are not classy to wear, then this watch is for you. It is very thin considering the nice construction of it, so you don't need to worry that it will be bulky and obtrusive. The width is about the same as any other typical men's watch. The color is black, so it could go nicely with any color shirt. I wear it to every occasion because it is quite versatile. Overall, I would recommend this watch to any man who wants something that will last without costing a fortune."

If you don't use the alarm and light the battery lasts a long, long, time. There are so many choices in a G-Shock now that I wouldn't try to say that this older design is the best but I can say it sure does last. Recently, I ripped the plastic bezel enough that I simply removed what was left. After 20 plus years, the plastic seemed to break down and was not as resilient, now I'm planning on spending the $18 and just getting it fixed instead of buying a new one. To me the watch is a link with my younger self, as many of us wore these watches in the Marine Corps, more than 20 years ago, because you couldn't break one except for perhaps the pins. We all pulled the watch heads off the lousy plastic bands and put them on cloth or Velcro bands. Timex makes a nice, cheap, Velcro Expedition band that works well on this watch. The Timex band has elastic loops where the pins go, which helps to keep from breaking a pin if the watch gets caught on something. Funny, in the mid-eighties, the lithium batteries for these watches were more than $20, and buying a new watch at the base exchange was the same price as getting the battery changed. We would just get a new watch if we wore the battery out using the light for map reading, etc. The reason I am relating that story is that we ""stress tested"" one of the watches who's battery was running out and nothing short of smashing it between a helmet and a concrete floor would kill one. Also, when I changed the battery on my current watch a few years back, I found out the batteries are now around $2 and instructions on replacing the battery are easily available on the Internet. So, in summary, I recommend this watch."

It takes mud, grease, dirt, salt water, sweat, etc. When it gets muddy, just hose it down. My current DW-5600E, with the battery failing after 10 years, gains a second every few days and the numbers are fading. This might be because of low voltage. This watch is not jewelry. It's rugged time piece for harsh sports and dirty work environments. The watch may outlast it's band. Aftermarket bands are available.  I just purchased a replacement DW-5600E.

The backlight on mine is green and is the perfect amount of time and light, and the watch has all of the basic functions I need while still remaining slim and classic looking. I own several dive watches along with dress watches, but this is the watch I wear the most. And after all of this beating, along with daily showering, the watch looks brand new.

It bounced around on the deck plates but never cracked or broke.  I was sold. This watch looks identical to that watch but is deficient in a few ways.  The second time zone feature is gone, and perhaps as a result the functions of the buttons are rearranged in a way that feels screwy.  New purchasers of the watch will probably like it just fine.  Users who bought the old version for $25 twenty years ago from the commissary will have the unpleasant feeling of talking to a best friend who's been lobotomized.

I mean, seriously. This watch has been around for 24 years (15 years in it's current configuration). In many ways, it IS the perfect watch. It has everything you need and nothing superfluous. In fact, CASIO calls it the ""quintessential G-SHOCK"". I couldn't agree more. For almost a quarter-century, this watch has been worn by people engaging in just about any task imaginable, in just about any condition imaginable. Even NASA has qualified this particular watch for space-flight missions.

It is basic with no distractions to just telling you the time, day and date. No automatic anything except that it knows how many days are in each month up to 2099. Ruggedness is its main trait, which has been described in many of the previous reviews. The worst I have done to it was upon opening the package the watch and hangar flew out and landed on our hardwood floor - no issues resulted. My watch had a very stiff Adjust button. It required a ballpoint pen to press it in enough to begin changing the time. I thought about returning it, but decided not to. The next time I used it, the adjust button pressed in fine without a tool. Speaking of time, it is an accurate watch, gaining about 10 seconds per month, within expectations. The band is comfortable, better than some other G-Shocks I tried that had sharp edges.  The display is clear and the numbers are an adequate size. It would be nice if they brought back the dual time feature for this watch. It is a strong, basic watch. The funny thing is I have several nicer looking and much more expensive watches, yet I usually prefer wearing this plain, rather clunky Casio. Why? I don't know - maybe because it is comfortable, light weight, and easy to read. It is like an honest reliable friend I can depend on. Five Stars, Recommended."

These days it's a minor/cult classic, loved for it's longevity and kind of cool as it's so unfashionable. This watch is kind of similar. It's a direct ancestor of the first G-Shock Casio launched in 1983 and hasn't changed much since it was introduced in 1996, except for a movement update to extend the auto-calendar to 2099 4 years ago. It's small compared to most current watches and kind of a curio as you probably haven't owned anything like it since the 80's,  I've had a more recent G-Shock (GW500-A) for about 5 years now and have come to really appreciate it. I bought it to wear at work as I'm a C/O and didn't want to subject my other watches to life in prison. That watch has held up extremely well and recently the G-Shock bug has bitten as I found myself looking around for another. This fits the bill perfectly. No Multiband 6 atomic timekeeping or Tough Solar here, just a big battery and 1 alarm, 1 stopwatch, and 1 timer. It's very simple to set up and I like the low-key look. I hope all the stories about indestructible build quality and mammoth battery life are true. I'll let you know, hopefully in about 15 years time. . ."

Otherwise, a great blast from the past (i.e. the 80's) when I last owned one but can't recall what happened to my old one. Think it needed a new battery but I didn't have the cash at the time, so traded it to a friend for something else a didn't have the money for (perhaps an Atari video game cartridge or some floppy disks for the Commodore 64). Bought the Casio DW-5600E for the big 50th birthday, but ended up returning it (very sad!). Casio ended up upselling me, as a soothed my disappointment by purchasing the GW-S5600-1JF (Carbon fiber band, milled titanium back, atomic time, & solar) at 4X the cost.

I wore it every day for years.  It endured every adventure, every activity and every life-changing event with accuracy and aplomb.  After over a decade, I began to wear the resin casing out.  At some point, the entire case crumbled away.  So I stopped wearing the watch and tossed it into a drawer.  Over the following years, I would occasionally be digging through the drawer looking for something else and I'd stumble upon the skeletal remains of my original G-Shock.  To my amazement, each time I found the watch not only functional but still keeping time... with the ORIGINAL BATTERY.  I'm now 39-years-old.  My wife and I just moved.  While going through our belongings, I came across my G-Shock and couldn't resist showing off the still functioning watch to my wife.  After 22 years the original battery was still going strong!  The mindboggling simplicity and endurance of the original G-Shock represents the benchmark of sturdiness and reliability.  If you're planning to dive to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, to trek though the Sahara, to ski to the South Pole or to pilot a spacecraft to Mars, you won't find a better suited watch than the original G-Shock."

Until a few years ago when the incandescent light bulb burned out, it worked perfectly.  I received a Casio G-Shock DW-6600 back in Middle School as a birthday present over ten years ago.  I have taken it camping, hiking, swimming, white water rafting, sea kayaking, mountain climbing, zip lining, SCUBA diving, geology trips, and every other activity where I would question any other watch's survival.  The watch still works beautifully.  There is a reason this is the watch of choice of EMTs, Police, Fire Fighters, soldiers, Army Rangers, Navy SEALs, the Delta Force, Team 6, etc., and the G-Shock has been flight qualified by NASA for manned spaceflight. I purchased my second G-Shock, a DW-5600, not because my old 6600 is broken, but as insurance in case the battery dies.  I like how the 5600 is thinner than my 6600, does not get snagged on long sleeves, and does not have the progress meter.  However, I prefer my 6600's 5-button interface over the 5600's 4-button.  For the stopwatch function, to reset the counter on the 6600, I can simply press the reset button.  On the 5600, I must press the recessed adjust button, a much more annoying and trickier step. My only complaint is with the G-Shock band.  The original on my 6600 broke after a few years of use.  I have replaced it with two other generic rubber straps, and a second G-Shock band, all of which have failed.  I now have it on a 16mm NATO strap.  This seems to be working better."

But this is actually a good thing. I bought this model over 22 or 23 years ago and was able to proudly wear it for around 10 or 11 years without a battery change or anything. I had to replace the band many times but it was worth it just to see how long I could make it last. Finally had to give up on it after around 11 years because the plastic casing around the body fell apart...so I put it's remains respectfully in a box which ended up in storage. About 2 weeks ago (probably a good 10 years since I retired it) I was digging through my shed for something and heard this faint but familiar beeping sound from years gone by. I opened the box from which the beeping was coming and there it was...the metal sleleton of my old CASIO beeping it's alarms ass off. I felt like I was reunited with a long lost friend. I couldn't believe it. I checked the time on it and it was off by maybe 20 minutes. I put it back in the box and will check up on it again in another 10 years. I was so impressed though that I felt compelled to buy another G-SHOCK CASIO. I just ordered it today and am looking forward to it's arrival. It's a different model though with analog hands. But I'm sure it will be another ""good friend"" to me for another 10 years.

It's very easy to set up, I set mine within 30 seconds out of the box without looking at directions(and I'm not that smart :)) it's a G-shock, so it should be able to handle anything I dish out. It's easy to read the time and date without pushing any buttons. I like the simplicity. I have much nicer watches that I enjoy wearing, but this will get some wrist time too. Oh, and I will add that my wife says it's ugly and she hates it, so I'm pretty sure it's not a watch to wear if you're trying to impress the ladies, but if you just want a watch to tell you the time, and not worry about messing it up, it'll definitely work."

I've had mine now for about 4 years and it's amazing that it only has a few scratches to show for the abuse it's been through; Rock-climbing, swimming in fresh, chlorinated and salt water, water skiing/wake boarding, snow boarding, the whole gambit of outdoor sports. Additionally, it's even had a few 50 - 100 pound servers land on it with no effect. It's comfortable, cheap and dependable. On the other hand; the undersized buttons are a bit of a nuisance, especially so when your struggling to turn your alarm off after a night of rambunctious debauchery. The button size coupled with the fact that a newer model G-Shock that comes with over-sized, easy-to-press buttons will only set me back another $10 - 15 is the main reason for my average rating, and also why I will be upgrading. I hope that the newer models are as durable as this one is. Also, I've been complimented/made-fun-of by the hipster cred this watch brings with it. Wasn't my intention when I bought this, but I can see how it could fit into the whole ""faux-geek-chic"" that some hipsters strive for, what with their Triforce Tattoos and lens-less glasses frames. Be wary!"

Since then, millions of these watches have gone around the world and have provided amazing longevity on the wrists of their owners.  The updated model is now the DW5600E-1V which came out in 1996 with a few modifications.  The current model has the night illuminator feature and 4 small screws holding the back in place instead of the original screwback design.  This makes for a lighter, more comfortable feel and the resin still holds up extremely well to the elements.  Some die hard original gshockers love the older models because they had a heavier, more solid feel.  However, with the current price point for this gem of a watch, in my mind, you can't find any better value anywhere for a no nonsense, bomb-proof daily wear time piece.  After all, who can argue with millions of satisfied customers, including police, armed forces, emergency responders and firemen??  They seem to gravitate to these and other models of gshock. To sum it up, it's an amazing watch at an amazing price with a proven track record of nearly 30 years with very few design changes.  Very impressive!"

When I was given the DW 5600E by a friend, my problems were solved. I purchased this watch as a Christmas gift for a longtime friend who was admiring  my watch this summer. The Casio reputation as a great workhorse goes without saying. I've put over 8 watchbands & probably 5 batteries in the DW 240. I guess this watch will probably be the last one that I'll have to buy, if you can go by the quality of the old 240. The watchband was replaced on the DW5600E for $18 on ebay. It seems to be a better, sturdier band than the DW240, so , as I mentioned earlier, Batteries & watchbands are all that should be needed for many years of service. The extra protection on the buttons was a great idea , as the old DW240 would sometimes get banged against something under normal wear & I have had to free-up the post. This is all the watch anyone would need, & makes a great gift."

I may also apply to other Casio G-Shock watches too. Somewhere a reviewer complained about the strap irritating their wrist to where they could not use it.  SOLUTION? cut a piece of quality Gaffer's tape. longer than the band plate to extend beyond the beginning of each strap, narrower than the two sides (so not visible). apply. cut second piece the same if needed. WHY Gaffers tape? 1.) it can removed without making a mess (NOT duct tape..) stays on. including in water (I doubt underwater diving in slat water) 2.) when you need to replace the battery gaffers tape comes off without a mess. 3.)illuminates the irritating spot (which is due to the strap edge connected at the watch side. After 3 years I am happy. It is not the same as the original. Timer and Light buttons are reversed. reset button is inset and requires my fingernail to press. strap is not same material, but the original one went brittle and broke off soddenly. and the crystal is a hardened plastic. It will scratch if hit onto something hard enough.. So, if you are looking at this and want to replace to the original, get over it. Just looked for the original used anywhere. It starts at $239.00  !!! It was a wonderful watch, but that was over thirty years ago Since them dollars have depreciated. $250 is today worth about the $40 back then. Good glass costs more, the diving limit was 300 meters, now 200meters (DE560e). And everything is made in China, each Japan's auto industry sub-contracts parts from Thailand and China. Times change. If you want the original, go find a used one and spend the $200 or more $$. otherwise, this one is fine, just take into account the flaws. About the wrist strap. You can find replacements for these newer Casio watches. just look. There are watch distributors that carry the whole line of the various types. in the USA. enjoy. Oh, and the different models have different color background light LED colors. Find one with back light on before buying"

I abused it like I do for watches, hunting, fishing, scuba diving, shop work, everything.  After 10 years or so the plastic finally peeled off it which made it uncomfortable to wear.  And I was getting to the point it was easier see an analog than a digital with out glasses so I bought an analog, wore it till it died, bought another self winding analog and it died today.  In the mean time that old Casio G Shock I bought back in the 1980's is still running.  I dug it out.  It was about 30 minutes off but it hasn't been set in 10 years or more.  The date and the day were still correct.  I think the battery is getting a little weak but it is the original battery.  Same band too.  Anyway I wear glasses all the time now and digitals are a lot cheaper than self winding analogs so I bought another one.

Screws on the watch back have shallow heads and take a Phillips head screw.  However the heads are so shallow that even a precision screwdriver has practically zero metal to engage the threads and the screws were overtightened at the factory so it takes a ridiculous amount of torque to loosen.  The result is that 3 of the screws just barely came out and the 4th was impossible and the screwhead stripped out. This resulted in the watch being summarily dispatched with the smash of a hammer and being tossed into the garbage can where it belongs. If you want longevity buy a watch with a screwdown caseback.  Otherwise there is a good chance the watch is disposable once the battery runs out."

The designers of this watch definitely put a great deal of thought into it. Aside from it's obvious g-shock ruggedness it's very accurate only being a few seconds off from my atomic watch at any given time. It even displays the time in the small box in the upper right when it's in stopwatch and countdown timer modes. I use the repeat function on the countdown timer when I do interval training. The light works great at night. I understand the watch is popular with U.S. Military Special Operations Forces and is also flight certified by NASA whatever that means. It's not a great looking watch but it's functionally elegant and looks like a retro '80's digital watch. Highly recommended for a sports watch!"

Through it all it's still on the original battery (expect that to last 10 years from what I read), and the original band seems as good as new.

My dad shrugged it off, ""It's the style for young people..."" My Casio G-Shock has been on my wrist for over 20 years.  I haven't tried to deliberately abuse it, but other than battery changes, and plastic casing changes, it's still there. Through sweat, dirt, bumps, knocks and drops, it's nice to know that your timepiece can handle the accidents that happen. Grampa would be proud. Can't find a new plastic casing, so I'm considering buying another just to strip the casing and put it on this one!

It contains time, date (day, month, year), a blue backlight for nighttime, a stopwatch and an alarm. This is the best and simplest casual watch you can possibly want on a watch, it is very durable and looks great.

The new replacements often have modifications that in my mind make them inferior to the originals. Sometimes it appears as though the new product was designed by someone who has actually never used one in ""real life."" Typically, I am forced to access the pre-owned market to get what I want. Not in this case. The Casio Men's G-shock Classic Digital Watch is very similar to the watch that replaced the stop watch, the dry land and not-so dry land wrist watch, and alarm clock a couple of decades ago. It has just enough functionally to be truly useful - time (24 or 12 hour), date (helps when filling out those forms that are becoming part of daily life), alarm (for those early morning activities), stop watch (for that interval training necessary to retain some of the speed of youth), and a couple of other things that have slipped my mind :-) all in a small and durable package.  Good, inexpensive, tough, useful watch."

Dilger","09 Dec 2008","5.0","In the beginning...","The very first Casio watch I had was a 50M dress watch, resin. When I saw a G-Shock advertised for a ridiculous price at a local discount store I determined to get there. Dropped off after work 15 miles away, I forded a 4 ft. deep stream, clambered through a patch of thorns as tall as me, and got hit by a car taking a 'shortcut' to the sale. The store tried to tell me they were out (because the paper had the wrong price) but I wasn't going anywhere without a watch. They finally relented and I got my G-Shock for a real bargain! And it took whatever punishment I gave it. From operating chain saws to cross-country running through mud and dust my G-Shock perservered. Always on time, stop-watch and alarm always ready, there was never a more useful tool in my essential survival kit. I bought it in 1987 and in 1995 I gave it to a homeless man, still running. That was one durable timepiece, it took the most beating of any of my half-dozen G-Shocks. I definitely recommend this series of watches."

That was a great watch. Years of abuse and no problems (baring the timekeeping being a little off, but I can live with that). I replaced it with this watch, which is worse in almost every way from the previous G-Shock I owned. The only improvement that I can see is the illumination - the screen lights up green and it's very clear in the dark. The main difference between this and the 20 year old DW-5600C is that this watch has a ""let moisture enter the watch"" feature, which means that on cold mornings or after a rapid change in humidity/temperature (like going outside) condensation forms on the inside of the screen. I ignored this for the approx nine months that I used the watch. About three weeks ago half the LCD decided to stop working overnight, so the watch is now useless. Anyway, to say that I'm disappointed is an understatement. I was a massive fan of G-Shocks up until I bought a new one. Where did it all go wrong Casio? If you're incapable of producing quality watches at this price point, then they should double/triple the price - I'd be glad to pay it for a replacement for my previous G-Shock (I hate the styling on the other, trendier (?) G-Shocks)"

Now the set buttons are smaller than those that came with the original DW-5000, so you can't press them accidentally, what means if you are in TIMER (countdown) mode, you'll stay there until you (not your shirt) prees the mode button again. Do you need more? OK: great design, clear numbers and a very readable LCD. It's light and keeps accurate all the modes: time, alarms, countdown timer (very useful) and stopwatch.

Appel","03 Sep 2011","3.0","Adequate but With Significant Flaws","I bought this watch to replace my Casio DW340, which was perfect for my needs and which lasted for decades. I wanted another DW340 but it seems that Casio no longer makes that model. Sad. The DW5600 contains almost all of the functions I need EXCEPT that it does not have a second time zone, which the DW340 had and which I kept set to UTC. This function is of critical importance to me and was almost a ""deal breaker"" on this item. The button assignments are not logical, with the stopwatch reset being in the upper left corner, the ""A"" button, while the other stopwatch functions are on the right side. Not only is the location awkward from an ergonomic standpoint, but this button is also the ""adjust"" button, and so it controls access to all the other watch functions. On the DW340 this button was recessed and flush with the case. On the DW5600, the button is both flush with the case and surrounded by rather high ridges, making it almost impossible to access. The composition casing is all hard edges versus the rounded edges of the DW340. When I began to wear the watch some of the edges literally dug into my wrist hard enough to make a bloody mark. One morning at work I took my penknife and ""eased"" all the sharp edges. I then cut down the ridge surrounding the ""A"" button so that I could access it more easily to reset the stopwatch. Proper attention to design by Casio would have made my homemade modifications unnecessary. The stopwatch also oddly drops the 1/10s function after it reaches one hour as the area on the 340 that contained the hour now contains the regular time. The only items where the DW5600 is an improvement on the DW340 is that the display is a bit more legible and the backlight function is superior to the light function in the DW340. Unfortunately, Casio made some significant errors in this watch, including the design of the casing with its sharp edges and high ridges, the elimination of the second time zone, and the loss of  1/10s on the stopwatch. I wish Casio had kept the DW340 as it was except for the DW5600's backlight. I'm using the DW5600 but I'm still looking for a replacement for my DW340."

I didn't like how the strap is kinda stiff and it pinches your skin sometimes.  Other than that, I don't have any other issues with this watch so far. Aside from that, Amazon's shipping has become SUPER SLOW now.  Even though I selected for free shipping, I would sometimes get the items before the schedule delivery date and sometimes on the first few days of the schedule delivery date, but never on the last day of the schedule delivery date. They've been delivering items on the very last day for over a year now.

My previous watch was also a Casio Illuminator and was a great watch. Had it for about 20 years. The G-Shock looks good and at first I thought it was really good. That quickly changed. I use the stop watch function a lot mainly for running and sprints. The buttons are too far recessed and are a pain in the neck to activate. When finishing a sprint I am fumbling trying to press the button - useless. My previous watch did not have this problem. Also find it difficult to press the button to activate the light at night. Don't wish to sound sexist but this watch may have been designed by a female who has no trouble pressing the buttons due to long fingernails.

But there are two main drawbacks that can be improved, one of which is Casio's fault and the other one is just a style issue. 1) the edge between the watch face and the watch bands bends considerably and there is a tear emerging after a couple of months of use. This is more prominent if you have a thin wrist and use one of the shorter holes on the band. 2) It is a bit too thick aesthetically. I know it is very durable and has a great protective casing but I feel it would look better in a thinner version."

I have had this exact same watch for many years, finally having to replace it. For some unknown reason, CASIO dropped the DUAL TIME feature. WHY?? All of the other features are still available and no new features were added, so why did they drop a very useful feature for travelers. Even their cheaper ($15) watches have dual time, so it cannot be an expensive feature. Just does not make any sense to delete features from one of the most successful watches ever designed. A little disappointed in CASIO!"

G-shock shaped band curves around wrist is more comfortable, W217 your wrist curves the band. G-shock chime is discrete even if forgotten, W217 is ear piercing. G-shock has timer, W217 does not.

As a kid I had always wanted an original G-Shok since they came out in the '80's, but somehow never got around to getting one.  They are sold about everywhere. Bought on Amazon through a Warehouse deal as it was cheaper than Walmart as the price is pretty standard at just under $40.  There are a million reviews on YouTube and the internet.  I'm not going to add anything meaningful to the discussion, other than to say if you are any sort of watch person, you should own one.  This is as close as you can find to the original in current production. Maybe spring for the solar one if that is important, but the battery life is pretty good on these."

I know why they made it this way.... to keep from accidently changing the settings. But I would rather have it as easy to push as the other three and take my chances. It's just very difficult to push.  Despite this, I'm still glad I have it and will continue to wear it no matter what I'm doing.  Great, rugged watch."

The functionality is simple. It may be just a bit more complex than the F91W, but it’s not too far off. Doesn’t take much to learn to set it up the way you want, and it stays put once you’re done. The price ain’t shabby for this historic G-Shock. I mean, fifty something bucks is very reasonable for something this tough and cool. If you can find it cheaper, more power to you. Not only is this watch NASA flight approved, it holds a world record for heaviest vehicle to drive over a watch. Impressive to put it mildly, You got the usual functions found in most Casios and G-Shocks; timer, stop watch, alarm, 12/24 hour format, and back light. Dimensions should accommodate most wrist sizes, and the overall design of the watch is simple and sporty. Awesome history, insanely tough, practical simplicity, and affordable. This watch would make a perfect first G-Shock, or an addition to any watch collection."

Accurate and water proof to 200 meters. It's comfortable to wear, light weight and looks really nice. Good backlight. Doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the more expensive G-Shock watches. Does not have a compass, barometer etc. etc. but I just needed a rugged time piece for when the going gets tough in adverse outdoor situations. The only thing that some may not like is: I have a 6 1/2"" wrist It's size is just right. Therefore the display is small that some (with poor eyesight like me) may find it a little difficult to read under certain conditions. Also, if you have a very large wrist the watch will look like you're wearing a woman's watch. For me it's a 5 Star watch!"

Again - amazing watch. I never took it off (swimming, showering, etc...) As solid as my first one...until I tried changing the battery in 2008. (Did you get that? The battery lasted 12 years...) I messed up and didn't get the gasket seated properly. My wife bought me my 3rd Casio G-Shock in 2009 and I am using that to this day. I just bought this watch for my son to wear as we train for our next backpacking adventure. He loves it and also wears it everyday. I can't say enough how much I love this watch.

Usually I’m doing good to get maybe 2 years of service with that brand before they start quitting on me. Well, I decided to do research on another brand of watches for durability and dependability. After reading many reviews about the Casio GShock watch, I felt like this was the best replacement for my lifestyle. I’m a baseball umpire, as well as a football and basketball referee. It’s important for me to have a good timepiece for these events. I’ve been using this for football with the timer, because lately we’ve had to keep the game time on field due to lack of dependable clock operators. This watch has done excellent for this sport and I have been using it to keep the time limit on fall baseball games as well. I like the features of the buttons being more difficult to push in order to keep from accidentally hitting the buttons by mistake. Being shock proof and waterproof is also a plus. The price is very good for what you need in my situation, and I will certainly buy another one if this one ever quits. I’m not being paid for my opinion, but I feel like this is a good product that deserves comments it deserves. Well done"

I finally wanted to try a G-shock. When I ordered it, I wasn't sure I was going to like it. I thought it would be too big and bulky and unattractive. Thankfully, it turned out I was wrong. I really like it. Seems quite durable. It's  just a bit of a step up from some of my Casio Heavy-Duty watches which I enjoy wearing. The watch is very comfortable. I have a narrow wrist, but it fits well, and with all the options with the amount of holes in the strap, you will definitely find a fitting that's good for you. What I also like is the decorative printing around the watch face. The white outline, the grey border around the screen, the white gold and blue lettering...it all works well. Also like the Shock Resist logo on the bottom. The text and outline are in gold, and there's a red trapezoid under the text. It's very symmetrical (unlike the atomic version). Setting up the watch was easy. Similar to other Casio modules. I did not have to set the year (there was no option for that...or maybe I missed it?). Also, from what I recall, it was set close to the actual time when I took it out of the box. All in all, I really like it. A statement digital watch, if you will. Of course, it's not for everyone, but if you like masculine digital watches, and one that will probably last a long time, you will be happy with your choice."

A purpose built tool watch. You need this in your collection. The other Gs are good, but this is the one to own.

I wear it every day at work, which I do flooring for a living so this watch takes a beating. It holds up very well to everything I throw at it. It's waterproof up to 600 feet deep, and I've seen videos of it being run over by a semi and survive. It's pretty much the same watch they've been making since 1987. That's what I love about it, it's retro styling. It's the same watch Keanu Reeves wears in the movie Speed, and Steve Carell wears one in the 40 Year Old Virgin. It's been worn by navy seals, the police, and even by NASA. I just like having the time on my wrist rather than having to rely on my phone all the time, which with my job I can't do without breaking my phone. This watch is very accurate down to the second. It's worth every penny, in fact I think it's cheap for what you actually get. Go back to the basics and get a great watch for a great deal. It's one tough watch, and I highly recommend it!"
